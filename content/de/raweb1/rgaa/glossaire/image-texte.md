Image of text.

Note: the use of image of text is not recommended. Where it is possible to reproduce the same effects in CSS, {% crit 1.8 %} requires that the text be reproduced in CSS text, or that a replacement mechanism allows the user to replace these images with [styled text](#text-style) in CSS.
