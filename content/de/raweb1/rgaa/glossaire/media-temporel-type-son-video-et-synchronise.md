title: Time-based media (audio, video and synchronised)
---

* Temporal media only audio: sound content (Wav, Mp3...) ;
* Temporal media only video: moving or sequenced images or photos;
* Synchronised temporal media: audio or video streams synchronised with another format to present information and/or including interactive temporal components. Temporal media can be viewed in 2 different ways:

- Downloadable file that can be viewed with software external to the web page;
- Content embedded in the web page which can be consulted within the web page via :
  - The `<video>` element (e.g. a video);
  - The `<audio>` element (e.g. a podcast);
  - The `<svg>` element (for example, a vector cartoon);
  - The `<canvas>` element (for example, a bitmap cartoon);
  - The `<bgsound>` element to broadcast a background sound to the web page.

Temporal media can be broadcast in real time or offered for playback asynchronously (pre-recorded media).

Note 1: animated gifs and image animations created using JavaScript or CSS are not considered to be temporal media.

Note 2: the '<bgsound>' element is specific to Internet Explorer and should not be used.
