title: In each web page, does each change of [reading direction](#reading-direction) (attribute `dir`) check these conditions?
steps:
  - The value of the `dir` attribute conforms (`rtl` or `ltr`)
  - The value of the `dir` attribute is relevant.
---

1. For each text passage validated in test 8.10.1, check that :
   - The reading direction is correct (ltr, for the direction "left to right" and rtl for the direction "right to left")
   - The reading direction is relevant.
2. If this is the case for each passage of text, **the test is passed**.
