1. Find text passages in the document that use a language that is read in the opposite direction to the document language (such as Arabic or Hebrew for French, for example).
2. For each text passage, check that the text passage is contained in a tag which has a `dir` attribute.
3. If this is the case for each text passage, **the test is validated**.
