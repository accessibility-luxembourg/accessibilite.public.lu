title: For each feature that transmits, converts or records [pre-recorded time-synchronised media](#media-temporel-type-sound-video-and-synchronise) that has a [synchronised subtitles](#subtitles-synchronises-object-multimedia) track, at the end of the process, do the subtitles meet these conditions?

1. Identify the functions that allow you to transmit (e.g. send content to another terminal or send a video by e-mail), convert (e.g. convert a video in .avi format to .mpg format) or record pre-recorded synchronised time-based media (e.g. record a video from a broadcasting platform onto your personal computer). 
2. Perform each of the functions (transmit, convert and record).
3. For each function, check that the subtitles :
   - are always present ;
   - can be displayed ;
   - are correctly synchronised;
   - retain their key features (for example, if the subtitles were coloured according to the speaker, the colours must be retained).
4. If this is the case, the test is validated.
