title: In each web page where they are present, do the [header](#header-area), [main navigation](#menu-and-navigation-bar), [main content](#main-content-area), [footer](#footer-area) and [search engine](#search-engine-internal-to-a-website) regions comply with at least one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The zone has a WAI-ARIA role of type [landmark](#landmarks) corresponding to its nature.
  - The zone has a title whose content makes it possible to understand the nature of the zone's content.
  - The zone can be hidden by means of a button directly preceding the zone in the order of the source code.
  - The zone can be avoided by means of a [avoid link](#links-avoidance-or-fast-access) directly preceding the zone in the order of the source code.
  - The zone can be reached by means of a [quick access link](#links-d-evitement-ou-d-acces-rapide) visible or, failing that, visible when focused.

1. Find the content grouping zones in the document (header region, main navigation region, main content region, footer region and search engine region).
2. For each zone, check that the zone
   - either has a WAI-ARIA landmark role corresponding to its nature;
   - either has a hierarchy title whose content makes it possible to understand the nature of the zone content; or
   - can be hidden by means of a button directly preceding the zone in the order of the source code;
   - can be avoided by means of an avoid link directly preceding the zone in the order of the source code; or
   - or can be reached using a quick access link, either visible by default, or visible when focused during tabbing.
3. If this is the case for each content grouping zone, **the test is validated**.
