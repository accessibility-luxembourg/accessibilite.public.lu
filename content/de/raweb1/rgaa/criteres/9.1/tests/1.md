title: In each web page, is the hierarchy between [titles](#title) (tag `<hx>` or tag with a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="heading"` associated with a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-level`) relevant?
---

1. Find the titles in the document (tag `<hx>` or tag with a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="heading"` associated with a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-level`).
2. Check that the hierarchy between the titles is appropriate.
3. If it is, **the test is validated**.
