title: Does each group of [fields of same kind](#fields-of-same-kind) have a [legend](#legende) ?
---

1. Find the groups of fields of the same kind in the document.
2. For each group of fields of the same kind, check that :
   - If the grouping uses a `<fieldset>` element, the `<fieldset>` element has a `<legend>` element.
   - If the grouping element uses a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="group"` or `"radiogroup"`, it has a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`.
3. Otherwise, for each of the fields of the same kind, check for the presence of :
   - either a title attribute to determine whether the field belongs to the field grouping ;
   - an `aria-label` attribute to determine whether the field belongs to the field grouping; or
   - or an `aria-labelledby` attribute which references a text passage used to determine whether the field belongs to the field grouping;
   - or an `aria-describedby` attribute which references a text passage used to determine whether the field belongs to the field grouping;
4. If this is the case for each group of form fields or for each of the fields of the same kind, **the test is validated**.
