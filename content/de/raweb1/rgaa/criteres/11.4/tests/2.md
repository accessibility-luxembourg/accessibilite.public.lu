title: Does each [label](#form-field-label) [located next to](#label-and-field-located-next-to-each-other) a [field](#form-input-field) (except for checkboxes, radio buttons or tags with a `role="checkbox"`, `role="radio"` or `role="switch"`WAI-ARIA attribute), check these conditions (except special cases)
steps:
  - The label is visually [docked](#label-and-field-located-next-to-each-other) immediately above or to the left of the [form field](#form-input-field) when the reading direction of the label language is left to right.
  - The label is visually [adjoined](#label-and-field-located-next-to-each-other) immediately above or to the right of the [form field](#form-input-field) when the label's language reading direction is right to left.

1. Find form fields in the document which are not `<input>` elements of type `checkbox` or `radio` or elements with a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="checkbox"`, `role="radio"` or `role="switch"`.
2. For each form field, check that the label is visually attached:
   - Immediately above or to the left of the form field when the reading direction for the label language is left to right.
   - Immediately above or to the right of the form field when the label's language reading direction is from right to left.
3. If this is the case for each form field, **the test is validated**.
