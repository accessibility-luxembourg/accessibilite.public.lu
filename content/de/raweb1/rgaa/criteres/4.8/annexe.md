#### Special cases

Special cases are managed when :

- The [non-time-based media](#media-non-temporal) is used for decorative purposes (i.e. it does not provide any information);
- The non-time-based media is broadcast in a controlled environment;
- The [non-time-based media](#media-non-temporal) is inserted via JavaScript, checking the presence and version of the plug-in, to replace [alternative content](#alternative-content) already present.

In these situations, the criterion is not applicable.
