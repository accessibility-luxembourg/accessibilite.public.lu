title: Do error messages indicating that a mandatory field has not been entered meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The error message indicating that a mandatory field has not been entered is visible and allows the field in question to be identified by name.
  - The mandatory field has the `aria-invalid="true"` attribute.
---

1. Find the error messages in the document indicating that a mandatory field has not been entered.
2. For each error message, check that
   - either the error message is visible and allows the field concerned to be identified by name;
   - or the mandatory field associated with the error message has an `aria-invalid="true"` attribute.
3. If this is the case for each error message indicating that a mandatory field has not been entered, **the test is validated**.
