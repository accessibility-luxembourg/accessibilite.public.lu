title: Does each [text passage](#passage-de-texte-lie-par-aria-labelledby-ou-aria-describedby) associated via the WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute reveal the exact function of the [form input field](#champ-de-saisie-de-formulaire) with which it is associated?

1. Find the form fields in the document whose label is provided by a WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute.
2. For each form field, check that the content of the referenced text passage is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each form field, **the test is validated**.
