title: For each [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) only sound, only video or synchronised, does the adjacent textual content clearly identify the [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) (excluding special cases)?

1. Find pre-recorded time media in the document (video, audio or synchronised only).
2. For each time-stream, check that a passage of text (a title or paragraph, for example) immediately preceding or following the time-stream enables it to be identified.
3. If this is the case for each temporal media, **the test is validated**.
