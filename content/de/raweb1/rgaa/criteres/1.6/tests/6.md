title: For each vector image (tag `<svg>`) [information-carrying](#image-carrying-information), having a [detailed description](#description-detail-image), is any reference to the [detailed description](#description-detail-image) in the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute and the associated [detailed description](#description-detail-image) in the WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby` attribute correctly rendered (by assistive technologies)?
---

1. Find the information-carrying elements in the document (`<svg>`) for which a detailed description is provided using an `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby` attribute.
2. For each `<svg>` element, check that the content of the detailed description is correctly rendered (by assistive technologies).
3. If this is the case for each `<svg>` element, **the test is validated**.
