title: Does each [button](#button-form) of the image type (tag `<input>` with the attribute `type="image"`) [information-conveying](#image-conveying-information), which requires a [detailed description](#detailed-description-image), meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - There is an [alternative text](#text-alternative-image) containing a reference to a [detailed description](#detailed-description-image) adjacent to the image.
  - There is an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) giving access to the [detailed description](#detailed-description-image).
  - There is a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-describedby` associating a [text passage](#passage-de-texte-lie-par-aria-labelledby-ou-aria-describedby) acting as [detailed description](#detailed-description-image).

1. Find elements in the document `<input>` with the attribute `type="image"`, which contain information requiring a detailed description.
2. For each `<input>` element with the `type="image"` attribute, check that there is
   - either a text alternative containing a reference to a detailed description adjacent to the image;
   - a link or adjacent button giving access to the detailed description;
   - or a WAI-ARIA attribute aria-describedby associating a passage of text acting as a detailed description.
3. If this is the case for each `<input>` element with the `type="image"` attribute, **the test is validated**.
