title: For each bitmap image (tag `<canvas>`) [image conveying information](#image-porteuse-d-information), which implements a reference to an adjacent [detailed description](#detailed-description-image), is this reference correctly rendered (by assistive technologies)?
---

1. Find the information-carrying elements in the document (`<canvas>`) whose detailed description is provided by means of an `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby` attribute.
2. For each `<canvas>` element, check that the content of the detailed description is correctly rendered (by assistive technologies).
3. If this is the case for each `<canvas>` element, **the test is validated**.
