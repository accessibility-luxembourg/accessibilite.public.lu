title: Does each image (tag `<img>`) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information), which requires a [detailed description](#description-detaillee-image), meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - There is an [alternative text](#alternative-text-image) containing a reference to a [detailed description](#description-size-image) adjacent to the image.
  - There is an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) giving access to the [detailed description](#image-size-description).
---

1. Find images in the document that are structured using a `<img>` element (or an element with the WAI-ARIA attribute `role="img"`) and contain information that requires a detailed description.
2. For each image, check that there is :
   - Either a text alternative containing a reference to a detailed description adjacent to the image ;
   - Or a link or adjacent button giving access to the detailed description.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
