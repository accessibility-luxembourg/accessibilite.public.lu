title: Does each embedded image (tag `<embed>`) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information), which requires a [detailed description](#description-detaillee-image), meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - There is an [alternative text](#text-alternative-image) containing a reference to a [detailed description](#description-size-image) adjacent to the image.
  - There is an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) giving access to the [detailed description](#image-size-description).
---

1. Find elements in the document `<embed>` with the attribute `type="image/..."`, which contain information requiring a detailed description.
2. For each `<embed>` element with the attribute `type="image/..."`, check that there is
   - either a text alternative containing a reference to a detailed description adjacent to the image;
   - or an adjacent link or button giving access to the detailed description.
3. If this is the case for each `<embed>` element with the `type="image/..."` attribute, **the test is validated**.
