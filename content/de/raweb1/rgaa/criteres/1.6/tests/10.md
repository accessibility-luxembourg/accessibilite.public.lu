title: Does each tag with a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="img"` [information-carrying](#image-carrying-information), which requires a [detailed description](#description-detail-image), meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - There is a WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute containing the [text alternative](#text-alternative-image) and a reference to an adjacent [detailed description](#description-detail-image).
  - There is a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-labelledby` associating a [text passage](#passage-de-texte-lie-par-aria-labelledby-ou-aria-describedby) acting as a [text alternative](#text-alternative-image) and another acting as a [detailed description](#detailed-description-image).
  - There is a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-describedby` associating a [text passage](#passage-de-texte-lie-par-aria-labelledby-ou-aria-describedby) acting as a [detailed description](#detailed-description-image).
  - There is an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) leading to the [detailed description](#detailed-description-image).

1. Find the elements in the document with a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="img"` that contain information requiring a detailed description.
2. For each `role="img"` element, check that there is
   - either a WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute containing the textual alternative and a reference to an adjacent detailed description;
   - or a WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute associating a passage of text acting as a textual alternative and another acting as a detailed description;
   - or a WAI-ARIA `aria-describedby` attribute associating a passage of text acting as a detailed description;
   - or a link or an adjacent button giving access to the detailed description.
3. If this is the case for each `role="img"` element, **the test is validated**.
