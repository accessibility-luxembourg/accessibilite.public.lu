title: For each web application that enables [two-way voice communication](#application-web-de-communication-orale-bidirectionnelle) and [real-time text](#communication-ecrite-en-temps-reel), can both modes be used simultaneously?
---

1. Check that the web application allows two-way voice communication.
2. If so, check that real-time text (RTT) communication is available.
3. If this is the case, check that it is possible to use both modes of communication at the same time, i.e. that it is possible for the same user to speak and use the real-time text (RTT) system simultaneously.
4. If this is the case, the test is validated.
