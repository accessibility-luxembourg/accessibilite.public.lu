title: Does each pre-recorded video-only [time-based media](#media-temporel-type-son-video-and-synchronised) meet one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - The [textual transcription](#transcription-textual-media-temporal) is relevant.
  - The synchronised [audio description](#synchronised-audio-description-time-based-media) is relevant.
  - The synchronised [audio description](#synchronised-audio-description-time-based-media) of the alternative version is relevant.
  - The alternative audio version only is relevant.

1. Find pre-recorded video-only time-based media in the document that have a textual transcript.
2. For each video-only temporal medium, check the relevance of
   - either the textual transcription;
   - or synchronised audio description;
   - either the synchronised audio description of the alternative version; or
   - or the alternative audio version only.
3. If this is the case for each temporal medium, **the test is validated**.
