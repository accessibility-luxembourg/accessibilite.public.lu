#### Special cases

There is special case management when [time-based media](#media-temporel-type-sound-video-and-synchronise) or [non-time-based media](#media-non-temporel) is used for decorative purposes (i.e. it doesn't provide any information).

In these situations, the criterion is not applicable.
