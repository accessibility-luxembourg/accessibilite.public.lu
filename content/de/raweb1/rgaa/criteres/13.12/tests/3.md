title: Can the user deactivate motion detection to avoid accidental activation of the function (except in special cases)?
---

1. Find in the document the functions available by moving the device.
2. Check whether the user can disable motion detection.
3. If so, for each function, check that it cannot be triggered.
4. If this is the case for each function available by setting the device in motion, **the test is validated**.
