title: The [help desk](#service-d-assistance) meets the communication needs of people with disabilities directly or through [a relay service](#service-de-relais). Is this rule respected?
---

1. Identify the presence of a help desk on the Website.
2. If so, check that the help desk can be used by all people with disabilities. It may be useful to search the Website documentation to find this information. For example, if the help desk is available from a telephone number, check that there are alternative means for users who have little or no access to spoken language (people who are deaf or hard of hearing) or who cannot use verbal language (people with aphasia). For example 
	- an e-mail address or an online form;
	- instant messaging;
	- the provision of simultaneous written or visual translation of oral or audio information, or the provision of a sign language interpreter (use of a relay service).
3. If this is the case, the test is validated.
