title: For each content of the `<th>` tag applying to the whole row or column, does the `<th>` tag respect one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - The `<th>` tag has a unique `id` attribute.
  - The `<th>` tag has an `scope` attribute.
  - The tag `<th>` has a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="rowheader"` or `role="columnheader"`.
---

1. Find the data tables in the document.
2. For each header (element `<th>`) applying to the entire row or column, check that the element `<th>` has :
   - either a unique `id` attribute ;
   - a scope attribute ;
   - or a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="rowheader"` or `"columnheader"`.
3. If this is the case for each header applying to the entire row or column, **the test is validated**.
