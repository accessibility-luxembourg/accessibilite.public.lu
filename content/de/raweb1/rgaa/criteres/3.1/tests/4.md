title: For each [CSS property defining a colour](#propriete-css-determinant-une-couleur) and [conveying information](#image-vehiculant-une-information-donnee-par-la-couleur), the [information](#information-donnee-par-la-couleur) must not be given solely by the colour. Is this rule respected?

1. Find the information provided by the colour in a CSS property in the document.
2. For each of these pieces of information, check that there is another way of retrieving this information (presence of a title attribute, an icon or a graphic effect based on shape or position, a typographic effect, etc.).
3. If this is the case for each piece of information, **the test is validated**.
