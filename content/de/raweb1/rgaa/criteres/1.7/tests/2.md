title: Does each [button](#bouton-formulaire) of image type (tag `<input>` with the attribute `type="image"`) [carrying information](#image-carrying-information), having a [detailed description](#description-detaillee-image), check these conditions?
steps:
  - The [detailed description](#description-detaillee-image) on the page and indicated by the [text alternative](#alternative-text-image) is relevant.
  - The [detailed description](#description-detail-image) via an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) is relevant.
  - The associated text passage via the WAI-ARIA `aria-describedby` attribute is relevant.

1. Find elements in the document `<input>` with the attribute `type="image"` which have a detailed description.
2. For each `<input>` element with the `type="image"` attribute, check that the detailed description is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
