title: Does each [object image](#object-image) (tag `<object>` with the attribute `type="image/..."`) [information-conveying](#image-conveying-information), with a [detailed description](#detailed-description-image), meet these conditions?
steps:
  - The [detailed description](#detailed-description-image) on the page and indicated by the [text alternative](#text-alternative-image) is relevant.
  - The [detailed description](#detailed-description-image) adjacent to the [object image](#object-image) is relevant.
  - The [detailed description](#detailed-description-image) via an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) is relevant.
  - The associated text passage via the WAI-ARIA `aria-describedby` attribute is relevant.

1. Find elements in the document `<object>` with the attribute `type="image/..."` which have a detailed description.
2. For each `<object>` element with the `type="image/..."` attribute, check that the detailed description is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
