title: Does each embedded image (tag `<embed>` with the attribute `type="image/..."`) [information-carrying](#image-carrying-information), with a [detailed description](#description-image-size), meet these conditions?
steps:
  - The [detailed description](#description-detaillee-image) on the page and indicated by the [text alternative](#text-alternative-image) is relevant.
  - The [detailed description](#image-size-description) adjacent to the embedded image is relevant.
  - The [detailed description](#description-detail-image) via an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) is relevant.
  - The associated text passage via the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-describedby` is relevant.

1. Find elements in the document `<embed>` with the attribute `type="image/..."` which have a detailed description.
2. For each `<embed>` element with the `type="image/..."` attribute, check that the detailed description is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
