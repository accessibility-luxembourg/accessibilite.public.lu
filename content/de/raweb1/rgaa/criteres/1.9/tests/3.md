title: Does each embedded image with a [legend](#legende-d-image) (tag `<embed>` associated with an adjacent [legend](#legende-d-image), if necessary, meet these conditions?
steps:
  - The embedded image (tag `<embed>`) and its adjacent [legend](#legende-d-image) are contained in a tag `<figure>`.
  - The `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="figure"` or `role="group"`.
  - The `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute whose content is identical to the content of the [legend](#legende-d-image).
  - The [legend](#legende-d-image) is contained in a `<figcaption>` tag.
---

1. Find embedded images with a legend in the document (element `<embed>` with the attribute `type="image/..."`).
2. For each image, check that
   - the image and its legend are contained in a `<figure>` tag;
   - the `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA property `role="figure"` or `role="group"`;
   - the `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute whose content is identical to the content of the legend;
   - the legend is contained in a `<figcaption>` tag.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
