1. Select a page from the sample belonging to the same set of pages as the page being audited.
2. Compare the source code (generated on the client side) of the two pages and check that the means of access to the site map is always in the same place in the structure (in relation to the relative order of the page elements, for example it is always at the top of the page).
3. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.
