title: In each set of pages, does the [bypass or skip link](#liens-d-evitement-ou-d-acces-rapide) to the [main content region](#zone-de-contenu-principal) meet these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - The link is located in the same place in the presentation.
  - The link is always in the same relative order in the source code.
  - The link is visible or, failing that, visible when focused.
  - The link is functional.

1. Find the main content region in the document (indicated by the visible main element).
2. Check that the bypass or skip link to the zone is
   - located in the same place in the presentation;
   - always present in the same relative order in the source code (generated on the client side);
   - visible when focused during tabbing;
   - functional.
3. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.
