title: Does each pre-recorded synchronised [temporal media](#media-temporel-type-son-video-et-synchronise) meet, if necessary, one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - There is a [textual transcription](#transcription-textual-media-temporel) accessible via an [adjacent link or button](#lien-ou-bouton-adjacent).
  - There is a clearly identifiable adjacent [textual transcription](#transcription-textual-media-temporal).
  - There is a synchronised [audio description](#audiodescription-synchronisee-media-temporal).
  - There is an alternative version with a synchronised [audio description](#synchronised-audio-description-time-based-media) accessible via an [adjacent link or button](#lien-ou-bouton-adjacent).

1. Find synchronised time-based media (elements `<video>` or `<object>`) in the document that require a textual transcript.
2. For each synchronised temporal medium, check for the presence of
   - either a textual transcription accessible via an adjacent link or button (a URL or an anchor);
   - or a clearly identifiable adjacent text transcript; or
   - a synchronised audio description; or
   - an alternative version with a synchronised audio description accessible by means of an adjacent link or button (a URL or an anchor);
3. If this is the case for each time-based medium, **the test is validated**.
