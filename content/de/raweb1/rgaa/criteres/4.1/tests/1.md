title: Does each pre-recorded audio-only [temporal media](#media-temporel-type-son-video-and-synchronise) meet, if necessary, one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - There is a [textual transcription](#transcription-textual-media-temporal) accessible via an [adjacent link or button](#lien-ou-bouton-adjacent).
  - There is a clearly identifiable adjacent [textual transcript](#transcript-time-based-media-media-temporal).
---

1. Find in the document the time-based media (elements `<audio>`, `<video>` or `<object>`) that require a textual transcript.
2. For each audio-only time-based media item, check for the presence of a textual transcript:
   - either accessible via a button or an adjacent link (a URL or an anchor);
   - or clearly identifiable adjacent.
3. If this is the case for each temporal medium, **the test is validated**.
