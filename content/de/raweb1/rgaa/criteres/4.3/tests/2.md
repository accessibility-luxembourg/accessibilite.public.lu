title: For each pre-recorded synchronised [time-based media](#media-temporel-type-sound-video-and-synchronise) with synchronised [subtitles](#subtitles-synchronise-object-multimedia) broadcast via a `<track>` tag, does the `<track>` tag have a `kind="captions"` attribute?
---

1. Find synchronised time-based media with synchronised subtitles in the document using a `<track>` element.
2. For each synchronised time-stream, check that the `<track>` tag has a `kind="captions"` attribute.
3. If this is the case for each time-synchronised medium, **the test is validated**.
