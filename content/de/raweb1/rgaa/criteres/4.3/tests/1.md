title: Does each pre-recorded synchronised [temporal media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) meet, if necessary, one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - The synchronised [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) has [synchronised subtitles](#sous-titles-synchronises-multimedia-object).
  - There is an alternative version with [synchronised subtitles](#synchronised-captions-media-object) accessible via an [adjacent link or button](#lien-ou-bouton-adjacent).
---

1. Find synchronised pre-recorded time-based media in the document.
2. For each synchronised time-lapse media, check for the presence of
   - either synchronised subtitles;
   - or an alternative version with synchronised subtitles accessible via a link or adjacent button.
3. If this is the case for each time-lapse medium, **the test is validated**.
