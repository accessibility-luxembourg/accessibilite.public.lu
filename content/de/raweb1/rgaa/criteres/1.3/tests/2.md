title: For each [area](#zone-d-une-image-reactive) (tag `<area>`) of a [image map-reactive](#image-reactive) [information-carrying](#image-carrying-information), having a [text alternative](#alternative-textual-image), is this alternative relevant (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - If present, the content of the `alt` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the content of the `title` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the content of the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the [text passage](#text-passage-bound-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) associated via the `aria-labelledby` WAI-ARIA attribute is relevant.

1. Find elements in the document `<area>` with a textual alternative.
2. For each element `<area>`, check that the textual alternative is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
