title: Each image (tag `<img>` or tag with WAI-ARIA attribute `role="img"`) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information), having a [text alternative](#text-alternative-image), is this alternative relevant (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - If present, the content of the `alt` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the content of the `title` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the content of the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the [text passage](#passage-of-text-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) associated via the `aria-labelledby` WAI-ARIA attribute is relevant.

1. Find images in the document structured using a `<img>` element (or an element with the WAI-ARIA attribute `role="img"`) with a text alternative (image).
2. For each image, check that the text alternative is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
