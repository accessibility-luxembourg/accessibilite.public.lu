title: For each bitmap image (tag `<canvas>`) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information), having an [alternative text](#text-alternative-image) or an [alternative content](#alternative-content), is this alternative relevant (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - If present, the content of the `title` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the content of the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the [text passage](#text-passage-bound-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) associated via the `aria-labelledby` WAI-ARIA attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the [alternative content](#alternative-content) is relevant.

1. Find the elements in the document `<canvas>` that have an alternative text.
2. For each element `<canvas>`, check that the textual alternative is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
