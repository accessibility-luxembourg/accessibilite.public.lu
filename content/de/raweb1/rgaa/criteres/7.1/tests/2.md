title: Does each [script](#script) that generates or controls a [user interface component](#composant-d-interface) respect one of these conditions
steps:
  - The [user interface component](#composant-d-interface) is [correctly rendered](#correctly-rendered-by-assistive-technologies) by assistive technologies.
  - An accessible [alternative](#alternative-a-script) provides access to the same functionality.

1. For each user interface component that has passed test 7.1.1, check that the user interface component is correctly rendered (by assistive technologies).
2. If not, check that an accessible alternative to the user interface component provides access to the same functionality.
3. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.
