title: Does each [script](#script) that generates or controls a [user interface component](#user-interface-component) check, if necessary, one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The [name, role, value, settings and status changes](#name-the-role-the-value-the-settings-and-status-changes) are accessible to assistive technologies via an accessibility API.
  - An accessible [user interface component](#user-interface-component) providing access to the same functionality is present on the page.
  - An accessible [alternative](#alternative-to-a-script) provides access to the same functions.

1. Find all the user interface components generated or controlled using JavaScript in the document.
2. Check that
   - The component has a role consistent with its use (generally a button or a link).
   - The component has an explicit name.
   - The name of the component is consistent with the state of the functionality or controlled content (for example, for a functionality that displays or hides a content zone).
3. If not, check that there is an accessible user interface component providing access to the same functionality.
4. If not, check for the presence of an accessible alternative providing access to the same functionality.
5. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.
