title: Does each image (tag `<img>`) [decorative image](#image-de-decoration), without [legend](#legende-d-image), meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The `<img>` tag has an empty `alt` attribute (`alt=""`) and no other attribute to provide a [text alternative](#alternative-text-image).
  - The `<img>` tag has a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"` or `role="presentation"`.
---

1. Find decorative images in the document without a legend structured using a `<img>` element.
2. For each image, check that the image has no `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label` or `title` attributes and that it has
   - an empty `alt` attribute (`alt=""`);
   - or a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"` or `role="presentation"`.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
