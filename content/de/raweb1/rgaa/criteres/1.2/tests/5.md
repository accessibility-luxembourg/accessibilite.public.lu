title: Does each bitmap image (tag `<canvas>`) [decorative image](#image-de-decoration), without [legend](#legende-d-image), meet these conditions?
steps:
  - The tag `<canvas>` has a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"`.
  - The `<canvas>` tag and its children have no [text alternative](#alternative-text-image).
  - There is no text acting as a [text alternative](#alternative-text-image) between ``<canvas> and ``</canvas>.
---

1. Find decorative images in the document without a legend structured using a `<canvas>` element.
2. For each image, check that the `<canvas>` element has no `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label` or `title` attributes and that it
   - has a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"`;
   - and has no text alternative;
   - and has no alternative content between the ``<canvas> and ``</canvas> tags.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
