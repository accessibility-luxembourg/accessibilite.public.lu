title: Does each vector image (tag `<svg>`) [decorative image](#decorative-image), without [legend](#image-caption), meet these conditions?
steps:
  - The tag `<svg>` has a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"`.
  - The `<svg>` tag and its children have no [text alternative](#text-alternative-image).
  - The tags `<title>` and `<desc>` are missing or empty.
  - The `<svg>` tag and its children have no `title` attribute.
---

1. Find decorative images without a legend in the document, structured using a `<svg>` element.
2. For each image, check that the `<svg>` element has no `aria-labelledby` or `aria-label` attributes and that it
   - has a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"`;
   - and has no text alternative (including its child elements);
   - and does not contain elements `<title>` and `<desc>` unless empty of content;
   - and has no `title` attribute (and its child elements).
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
