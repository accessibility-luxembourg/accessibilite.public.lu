title: Does each [object image](#image-objet) (tag `<object>` with attribute `type="image/..."`) [decoration](#image-de-decoration), without [legend](#legende-d-image), meet these conditions?
steps:
  - The tag `<object>` has a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"`.
  - The `<object>` tag has no text alternative.
  - There is no alternative text between ``<object> and ``</object>.
---

1. Find structured decorative images without a legend in the document using a `<object>` element (with a `type="image/..."` attribute).
2. For each image, check that the opening tag `<object>` does not have `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label` or `title` attributes and that it
   - has a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"`;
   - and has no text alternative;
   - and has no alternative content between the ``<object> and ``</object> tags.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
