title: Does each embedded image (tag `<embed>` with attribute `type="image/..."`) [decorative image](#image-de-decoration), without [legend](#legende-d-image), meet these conditions?
steps:
  - The tag `<embed>` has a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"`.
  - The `<embed>` tag and its children have no [text alternative](#text-alternative-image).
---

1. Find decorative images in the document without a structured legend using a `<embed>` element (with a `type="image/..."` attribute).
2. For each image, check that the `<embed>` element does not have `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label` or `title` attributes and that it
   - has a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"`;
   - and has no text alternative;
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
