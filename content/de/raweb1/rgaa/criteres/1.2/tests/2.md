title: Does each [non-clickable](#non-clickable-area) [decoration area](#decorative-image) (tag `<area>` without attribute `href`), check one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The `<area>` tag has an empty `alt` attribute (`alt=""`) and no other attribute to provide a [text alternative](#text-alternative-image).
  - The `<area>` tag has a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"` or `role="presentation"`.
---

1. Find decorative images structured in the document using a `<area>` element (without a `href` attribute).
2. For each image, check that the `<area>` element has no `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label` or `title` attributes and that it has
   - an empty `alt` attribute (`alt=""`);
   - or a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"` or `role="presentation"`.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
