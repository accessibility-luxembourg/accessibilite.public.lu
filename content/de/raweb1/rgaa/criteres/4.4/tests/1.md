title: For each pre-recorded synchronised [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) with [synchronised-subtitles](#subtitles-synchronises-object-multimedia), does at least one subtitle track meet these conditions?
steps:
- The subtitles are in the language of the video;
- The subtitles are relevant;
- The subtitles are correctly synchronised. 
---

1. Find the time-synchronised media with synchronised subtitles in the document.
2. For each time-synchronised medium, check that the subtitles are
	- in the language of the video (if the spoken content is in English, the subtitles must be in English); 
	- relevant (all important audio information is present, particularly dialogue);
	- correctly synchronised. If there is no delay between the spoken content and the appearance of the subtitles, the subtitles are correctly synchronised. The reference standard specifies that subtitles should appear within 100 ms of the [subtitle time stamp](#horodatage-time-stamp).
3. If this is the case for each time-synchronised media, **the test is validated**.
