title: In each web page, for each [temporal media](#media-temporel-type-son-video-et-synchronise), information must not be conveyed solely [by shape, size or location](#indication-conveyed-by-shape-size-or-location). Is this rule implemented appropriately?
---

1. Find the information in the document for a time-based medium given by its shape, size or position.
2. For each item of information given by shape, size or position, check that the alternative means of retrieving this information is relevant, i.e. that it allows the information to be transmitted in all viewing contexts and for all users.
3. If this is the case for each piece of information, **the test is validated**.
