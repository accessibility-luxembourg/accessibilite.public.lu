title: For each [temporal media](#media-temporel-type-son-video-et-synchronise), does each feature check one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The functionality is [accessible and operable by keyboard and any pointing device](#accessible-and-operable-by-keyboard-and-any-pointing-device).
  - Functionality [accessible and operable by keyboard and any pointing device](#accessible-and-operable-by-keyboard-and-any-pointing-device) to perform the same action is present on the page.

1. Find the time-based media with control functions in the document.
2. For each time-based medium, check that
   - either the functionality is accessible via the keyboard and any pointing device;
   - or a function accessible via the keyboard and any pointing device enabling the same action to be performed is present on the page.
3. If this is the case for each time-based medium, **the test is validated**.
