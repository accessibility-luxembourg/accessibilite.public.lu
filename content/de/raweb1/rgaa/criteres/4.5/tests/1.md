title: Does each pre-recorded video-only [time-based media](#media-temporel-type-son-video-and-synchronised) satisfy, if necessary, one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - There is a synchronised [audio description](#audiodescription-synchronisee-media-temporal).
  - There is an alternative version with a synchronised [audio description](#audiodescription-synchronisee-media-temporel).
---

1. Find in the document the pre-recorded video-only temporal media that require an audio description.
2. For each time-lapse video-only medium, check for the presence of :
   - either a synchronised audio description ;
   - or an alternative version with a synchronised audio description accessible via a button or an adjacent link (a URL or an anchor).
3. If this is the case for each time-only video medium, **the test is validated**.
