title: Each "[image of text](#image-text)" button (tag `<input>` with the attribute `type="image"`) [image conveying information](#image-conveying-information), in the absence of a [replacement mechanism](#mechanism-of-replacement), must if possible be replaced by [styled text](#texte-style). Is this rule respected (excluding special cases)?

1. Find the "image of text" buttons in the document (element `<input>` with the attribute `type="image"`).
2. For each image, check that :
   - either there is a replacement mechanism ;
   - or the image contains text that uses a graphic effect that cannot be reproduced in CSS.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
