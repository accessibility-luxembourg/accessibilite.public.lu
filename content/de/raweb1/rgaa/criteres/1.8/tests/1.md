title: Each [image of text](#image-text) (tag `<img>` or having a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="img"`) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information), in the absence of a [replacement mechanism](#mechanism-of-replacement), must if possible be replaced by [styled text](#texte-style). Is this rule respected (excluding special cases)?
---

1. Find structured images of text in the document using a `<img>` element (or an element with the WAI-ARIA attribute `role="img"`).
2. For each image, check that :
   - either a replacement mechanism exists ;
   - or the image contains text which uses a graphic effect which cannot be reproduced in CSS.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
