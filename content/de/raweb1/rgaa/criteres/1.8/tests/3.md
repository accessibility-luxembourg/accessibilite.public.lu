title: Each [image of text](#image-of-text) object (tag `<object>` with the attribute `type="image/..."`) [carrying information](#image-conveying-information), in the absence of a [replacement mechanism](#replacement-mechanism), must if possible be replaced by [styled text](#styled-text). Is this rule respected (excluding special cases)?
---

1. Find the object image of text in the document (element `<object>` with the attribute `type="image/..."`).
2. For each image, check that
   - either there is a replacement mechanism;
   - or the image contains text which uses a graphic effect which cannot be reproduced in CSS.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
