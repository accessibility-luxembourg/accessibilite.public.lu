title: Each [image of text](#image-text) bitmap (tag `<canvas>`) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information), in the absence of a [replacement mechanism](#mechanism-of-replacement), must if possible be replaced by [styled text](#texte-style). Is this rule respected (excluding special cases)?
---

1. Find the bitmap images of text in the document (element `<canvas>`).
2. For each image, check that
   - either there is a replacement mechanism;
   - or the image contains text that uses a graphic effect that cannot be reproduced in CSS.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
