title: Every SVG [image of text](#image-text) (tag `<svg>`) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information) whose text is not completely structured using `<text>` elements, in the absence of a [replacement mechanism](#mechanism-of-replacement), must if possible be replaced by [styled text](#texte-style). Is this rule respected (excluding special cases)?
---

1. Find the vector text images in the document (element `<svg>`) that carry information and whose text is not completely structured using elements `<text>`.
2. For each image, check that
   - either there is a replacement mechanism;
   - or the image contains text which uses a graphic effect which cannot be reproduced in CSS.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
