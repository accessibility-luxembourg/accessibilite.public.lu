title: Each embedded [image of text](#image-text) (tag `<embed>` with the attribute `type="image/..."`) [image conveying information](#image-conveying-information), in the absence of a [replacement mechanism](#mechanism-of-replacement), must if possible be replaced by [styled text](#texte-style). Is this rule respected (excluding special cases)?
---

1. Find the embedded images of text in the document (element `<embed>` with the attribute `type="image/..."`).
2. For each image, check that
   - Either there is a replacement mechanism;
   - Or the image contains text which uses a graphic effect which cannot be reproduced in CSS.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
