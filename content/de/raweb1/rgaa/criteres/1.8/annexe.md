#### Special cases

For this criterion, there is special case management when the text is part of a logo, a trade name, a [CAPTCHA](#captcha), a [test image](#image-test) or an image whose graphic accuracy is considered essential for the correct transmission of the information conveyed by the image. In these situations, the criterion does not apply to these elements.

#### Technical notes

As the text in vector images is real text, it is not affected by this criterion.
