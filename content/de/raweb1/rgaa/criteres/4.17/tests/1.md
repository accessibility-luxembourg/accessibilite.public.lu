title: For each pre-recorded [time-based media](#media-temporel-type-sound-video-and-synchronise), does the presentation of the subtitles respect one of these conditions?
steps:
- The user-defined subtitle presentation system settings apply to the subtitles.
- There is a feature on the page that allows the user to change the subtitle presentation settings.
---

1. Locate pre-recorded time-based media with subtitles.
2. Define one or more subtitle presentation parameters from the customisation options provided by the operating system, for example: subtitle size, colour, subtitle border style, background colour, background opacity, etc. (Note: the standard does not give a precise list of parameters that must be defined, so the ability to modify a single subtitle characteristic is sufficient to make the criterion compliant).
3. Check that the parameters defined are applied to the subtitles.
4. If not, check the page to see if there is a function that allows you to change the presentation parameters of the subtitles (on the page or directly from the media player). 
5. Check that the parameters defined are applied to the subtitles.
6. If this is the case, the test is validated.
