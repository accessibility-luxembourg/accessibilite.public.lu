title: For each [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) that has a [synchronised subtitles](#soustitres-synchronises-objet-multimedia) or [audio description](#synchronised-audio-description-time-based-media) track, do the control functionalities for these alternatives respect these conditions?
steps:
  - For each time-based media, the functionality that enables subtitles to be activated and deactivated is presented at the same level as the [main features](#main-features-of-a-time-based-media).
  - For each time-based media, the functionality that enables and disables audio description is presented at the same level as the [main features](#principal-features-of-a-time-based-media).

1. Locate pre-recorded time-based media with a synchronised subtitle track or audio description.
2. Check that it is possible to activate and deactivate subtitles or audio description without any additional steps to the main functions (play, pause, etc.).
3. If this is the case, the test is validated.

<i>Example:</i> If the play button can be activated from the interface by a simple mouse click (without the need to activate a first component to display a drop-down menu, for example), the subtitles function should be available in the same way, with a simple click. Conversely, if the subtitles function is available from a drop-down menu that must first be activated (by a mouse click, for example), it will not be considered to be at the same level, as there will be an additional step to perform.
