title: Does each [composite link](#lien-composite) meet one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - The [title (or accessible name) of link](#intitule-ou-nom-accessible-de-lien) alone makes it possible to understand its function and destination.
  - The [title (or accessible name) of link](#intitule-ou-nom-accessible-de-lien) added to the [link context](#contexte-du-lien) enables us to understand the function and destination of the link.

1. Find composite links in the document (links made up of both text content and image elements).
2. For each composite link, check that the information used to understand the function and destination of the link is :
   - either the title of the link alone, provided by the combination of the text content and the alternative text for the image ;
   - or the link context.
3. If this is the case for each composite link, **the test is validated**.
