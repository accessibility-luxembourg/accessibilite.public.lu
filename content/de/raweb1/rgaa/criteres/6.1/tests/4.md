title: Does every [SVG link](#link-svg) meet one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - The [title (or accessible name) of link](#intitule-ou-nom-accessible-de-lien) alone makes it possible to understand its function and destination.
  - The [title (or accessible name) of link](#intitule-ou-nom-accessible-de-lien) added to the [link context](#contexte-du-lien) enables us to understand its function and destination.

1. Find SVG links in the document (element `<svg>` which has an element `<a>` with an attribute `xlink-href` (SVG 1.1) or `href` (SVG 2)).
2. For each SVG link, check that what makes it possible to understand the function and destination of the link is :
   - either the title of the link alone, provided by the accessible name of the `<svg>` element (generally resolved from the content of a `<text>` element);
   - or the link context.
3. If this is the case for each SVG link, **the test is validated**.
