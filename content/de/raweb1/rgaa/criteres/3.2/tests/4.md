title: In each web page, does the text and bold image text with a rendered size greater than or equal to 18.5px meet one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - The [contrast](#contrast) ratio between the text and its background is at least 3:1.
  - A mechanism allows the user to display the text with a [contrast](#contrast) ratio of at least 3:1.

1. Find in the document text and text in bold images with a rendered size greater than or equal to 18.5px that could cause contrast problems.
2. For each of these texts, check that :
   - either the contrast ratio between the text and its background is at least 3:1 ;
   - or a mechanism allows the user to display the text with a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.
3. If this is the case for each text, **the test is validated**.
