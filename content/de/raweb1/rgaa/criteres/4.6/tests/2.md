title: For each synchronised [time-based media](#media-temporel-type-son-video-et-synchronise) with a synchronised [audio description](#audiodescription-synchronisee-media-temporel), is it relevant?

1. Find the synchronised time-based media with an audio description in the document.
2. For each time-based media, check that the synchronised audio description is relevant (all the visual information that can be vocalised in the blanks of the main soundtrack is present, including inlaid text).
3. If this is the case for each time-synchronised medium, **the test is validated**.
