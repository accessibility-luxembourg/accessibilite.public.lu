title: For each pre-recorded video-only [time-based media](#media-temporel-type-sound-video-and-synchronised) with a synchronised [audio description](#audiodescription-synchronisee-media-temporel), is it relevant?

1. Find the video-only temporal media in the document that have an audio description.
2. For each time-based media, check that the synchronised audio description is relevant (all the visual information that can be vocalised in the blanks of the main soundtrack is present, in particular the inlaid texts).
3. If this is the case for each temporal medium (video only), **the test is validated**.
