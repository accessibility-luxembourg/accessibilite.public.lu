steps:
  - If present, the content of the `title` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the content of the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the [text passage](#text-passage-bound-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) associated via the `aria-labelledby` WAI-ARIA attribute is relevant.

1. Find in the document the elements `<canvas>` with a text alternative and used as a CAPTCHA or as a test image.
2. For each element `<canvas>`, check that the alternative text is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
