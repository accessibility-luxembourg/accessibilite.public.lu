title: For each area (tag `<area>`) of a responsive image used as a [CAPTCHA](#captcha) or as a [test image](#image-test), having a [text alternative](#alternative-text-image), is this alternative relevant?
steps:
  - If present, the content of the `alt` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the content of the `title` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the content of the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the [text passage](#text-passage-bound-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) associated via the `aria-labelledby` WAI-ARIA attribute is relevant.

1. Find elements in the document `<area>` with a text alternative and used as a CAPTCHA or as a test image.
2. For each element `<area>`, check that the alternative text is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
