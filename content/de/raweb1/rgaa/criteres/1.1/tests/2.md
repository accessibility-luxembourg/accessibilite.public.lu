title: Does each [area](#zone-d-an-image-reactive) in an [image map](#image-reactive) (tag `<area>`) [information-carrying](#image-carrying-information) have a [text alternative](#alternative-text-image)?
---

1. Find the elements `<area>` in the document.
2. For each `<area>` element, determine whether the reactive zone carries information.
3. Check that the reactive zone has at least one of the following textual alternatives:
   - content of the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-label` ;
   - content of the `alt` attribute;
4. If at least one textual alternative is found, **the test is validated**.
