title: For each [non-time-based media](#media-non-temporal), does each feature meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The functionality is [accessible and operable by keyboard and any pointing device](#accessible-and-operable-by-keyboard-and-any-pointing-device).
  - Functionality [accessible and operable by keyboard and any pointing device](#accessible-and-operable-by-keyboard-and-any-pointing-device) to perform the same action is present on the page.

1. Find non-time-based media with control functions in the document.
2. For each non-time-based media, check that :
   - either the functionality is accessible via the keyboard and any pointing device ;
   - or a function accessible via the keyboard and any pointing device enabling the same action to be performed is present on the page.
3. If this is the case for each non-time-based media, **the test is validated**.
