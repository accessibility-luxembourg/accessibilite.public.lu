title: For each [non-time-based media](#media-non-temporal), does each feature meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The functionality is [accessible and operable by keyboard and any pointing device](#accessible-and-operable-by-keyboard-and-any-pointing-device).
  - A [keyboard and any pointing device enabled](#accessible-and-operable-by-keyboard-and-any-pointing-device) feature to perform the same action is present on the page.

1. Find non-time-based media with control functions in the document.
2. For each non-time-based media, check that :
   - either the functionality can be activated using the keyboard and any pointing device ;
   - or a function that can be activated using the keyboard and any pointing device to perform the same action is present on the page.
3. If this is the case for each non-time-based media, **the test is validated**.
