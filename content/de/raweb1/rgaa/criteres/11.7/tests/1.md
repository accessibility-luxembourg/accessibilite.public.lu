title: Is each [legend](#legende) associated with a group of [fields of same kind](#champs-de-meme-nature) relevant?
---

1. Find groups of fields of the same kind in the document.
2. For each group of fields of the same kind in the form, or for each field of the same kind that has a legend, check that the text in the legend is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each group of form fields or for each of the fields of the same kind, **the test is validated**.
