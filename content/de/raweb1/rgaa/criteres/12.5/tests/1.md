title: In each [set of pages](#ensemble-de-pages), is the [search engine](#moteur-de-recherche-interne-a-un-site-web) accessible from an identical functionality?

1. Choose a page from the sample that belongs to the same set of pages as the page being audited.
2. Compare the source code (generated on the client side) of the two pages and check that the means of access to the search engine is always the same (a form field, for example).
3. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.
