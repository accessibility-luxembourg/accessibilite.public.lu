title: In the compliant [mechanism for displaying a correct contrast ratio](#mechanisme-qui-permet-d-afficher-un-rapport-de-contraste-conforme), are the colours of the component or of its information-conveying graphic elements sufficiently contrasted?
---

1. Find in the document the mechanisms that enable a compliant contrast ratio to be displayed.
2. For each of these mechanisms, check that the contrast ratio between the colours of the component or the information-conveying graphic elements of which it is composed is sufficiently high.
3. If this is the case for each mechanism, **the test is validated**.
