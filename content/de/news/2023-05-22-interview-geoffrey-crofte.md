<h4>Where does your interest in accessibility come from?</h4>
<p>As a general rule, people for whom this issue has become a personal matter are concerned, either directly or indirectly. For example, they may have someone close to them who is disabled, or they may be disabled themselves.</h4>
<p>This is not my case, as far as I know, but I was made aware of it about ten years ago, during my first professional experiences at <a href="https://www.alsacreations.com/">Alsacréations</a> in Strasbourg. They were already well advanced in web quality and had an accessibility expert. I learned from him and that influenced my user experience. Right from the start, I wanted to do things right, so that users - all users - could navigate the interfaces I was developing.</p>
<h4>Today, this concern has become a cause, a battle or, more simply, a matter of course, in the same way that it's hard to imagine a house without a front door?</h4>
<p>First and foremost, it's obvious: it's an integral part of my daily life. When I make a design decision, it applies to all users, including people with disabilities. Text needs to be large enough and in sufficient contrast for everyone, to give just one example, but there are many other points to consider.</p>
<p>Also, when I notice glaring problems on other platforms, I point them out, on LinkedIn or Twitter; in general I'm quite direct. That's where the struggle lies for me, because there is resistance to change. The classic feedback I get, "thank you, we'll pass it on to our technical teams", which is a polite response, doesn't necessarily lead to implementation. It's a pity, because the solution to be applied isn't always complicated.</p>
<p>My experience within the Foyer Group, and in particular Foyer Assurances, also enables me to understand that, above all, few people know that disabled people can use digital tools and that simple solutions exist. Unless we know people who are affected, it's easy to overlook the issue of digital accessibility. Sometimes it's just an extra layer of attention that gets integrated into our daily tasks.</p>
<h4>What challenges have you set yourself within your company?</h4>
<p>An audit carried out at the beginning of 2023 showed that our Website was 34% compliant with existing standards. We can double this score quite easily. Just as public bodies have to set an example before the new law on accessibility is applied to the private sector by 2025, it would be good for us to prove that, as an insurer, we are the first to make this effort.</p>
<blockquote><p>"In addition to raising awareness, we also need to provide training</p></blockquote>
<p>And this effort will benefit everyone: our customers, the company, and it's also an insurance policy that we're taking out for ourselves, later on... if we're lucky enough to grow old.</p>
<p>Whether it's the developer who's more familiar with the semantics of HTML language or the colleagues who make their PDFs more accessible, we need a trigger that makes them aware of the needs of these disabled users.</p>
<p>As well as raising awareness, training is also needed. Half of my design team and eight developers are taking accessibility training this year. This was decided last year. Accessibility is a natural extension of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) that we have been promoting for several years now.</p>
<h4>Is a 100% creative and innovative design compatible with a 100% compliant site in terms of accessibility?</h4>
<p>I tend not to like the term 100% accessible... but yes, you can comply with all the WCAG or RGAA criteria and still be creative. The <a href="https://www.grenoblealpesmetropole.fr/35-la-metropole-de-grenoble.htm">Grenoble metropolitan authority website</a> is 100% compliant. It looks great and, what's more, it's easy to understand. It's an example to follow.</p>
<p>Today, the techniques are there to produce elegant, animated content while respecting the preferences of those who choose to do without visual effects, display enhanced contrasts or navigate in dark mode, for example.</p>
<h4>If we had to change anything today in the field of accessibility, what would it be?</h4>
<p>Audits. The frameworks sometimes lack clarity or examples. From time to time, I struggle to understand what they're trying to tell us, even though I'm not new to the subject. Nowadays, anyone, expert or not, should have a simple, documented, demonstrative tool at their disposal, to help them improve the accessibility of their digital interfaces.</p>
