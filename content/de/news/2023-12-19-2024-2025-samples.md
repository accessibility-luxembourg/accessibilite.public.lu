<h3>You can react to the sample proposal drawn up by the SIP until 12 January 2024.</h3>

<div class="intro">
    <p>The 2023 digital accessibility audit campaign is drawing to a close, and in early January we will be publishing here a summary of the main conclusions we have drawn from this annual exercise. But before looking in the rear-view mirror, the SIP has prepared a sample proposal for the digital accessibility audit frame, for the years 2024 and 2025.</p>

<p>The underlying idea is to give the organisations concerned additional room for manoeuvre in order to aim for full compliance, the objective set by <a href="https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2019/05/28/a373/jo">the May 2019 law</a>.</p>
<p>The publication of this sample proposal also aims, as it does every year, to gather the opinions of the various representatives of people with disabilities in Luxembourg. An e-mail was also sent to them on 18 December, inviting them to react and give their views.</p>
<p>The final sample may change in order to incorporate their comments and, where appropriate, to take account of observations made by certain public bodies. For example, the timetable for the redesign of a web portal may not coincide with the proposed schedule.</p>
<p>The general public is invited to join in the discussion by contacting us at <a href="mailto:accessibilite@sip.etat.lu">accessibilite@sip.etat.lu</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/proposition-dechantillons-pour-le-controle-de-laccessibilite-numerique-2024-2025/">At this address</a>, you will find the sample proposals for monitoring digital accessibility 2024-2025.</p>
<p>You will be able to download two Excel files (one for each year) listing :</p>
<ul>
<li>the sites that will be subject to a full accessibility audit ;</li>
<li>the sites that will be subject to a simplified accessibility audit;</li>
<li>mobile applications that will be subject to a full accessibility audit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the number of audits per section must remain unchanged, i.e. 15 full web audits, 93 simplified web audits and 6 full mobile audits per year. We are also committed to selecting an equivalent number of iOS and Android apps. Finally, for each of the web lists, we are trying to achieve the most balanced representation of the following themes proposed by the European Union:</p>
<ul>
<li>culture and leisure ;</li>
<li>employment and taxation ;</li>
<li>education ;</li>
<li>housing and public amenities</li>
<li>public order and safety ;</li>
<li>environmental protection ;</li>
<li>social protection ;</li>
<li>health ;</li>
<li>transport ;</li>
<li>other.</li>
</ul>
<p>Thank you very much for your participation.</p>
