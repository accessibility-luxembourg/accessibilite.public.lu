<h2>A toolbox to ensure the accessibility of your PDFs</h2>
<h3>Following on from the frameworks devoted to the evaluation of websites (RGAA) and mobile applications (RAAM), here is one devoted to the PDF format</h3>
<hr>
<div class="intro">
    <p>PDF is not new: it is thirty years old. It wasn't until 2001 and the introduction of<span lang="en">tagged PDF</span>s that PDFs could be read by screen readers, the necessary interface for the blind and partially sighted.</p>
</div>
<p>Other developments followed, such as text reflow, a technique that allows users wishing to enlarge font size to adjust the width of the paragraph to that of the screen, saving them from having to scroll constantly from left to right to read the text.</p>

<p>However, two decades on, not all PDF documents are accessible, far from it. From texts scanned in image mode to a 100% compliant form, from LibreOffice to InDesign, there is a whole range of intentions and tools. Some authors, anxious to structure their document neatly using Word, will unknowingly make it accessible, like Monsieur Jourdain making prose without knowing it.</p>
<p>While Luxembourg's public sector websites and apps have been subject to accessibility requirements since 2019, the same applies to office automation file formats. Those published before the end of September 2018 are <a href="https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2019/05/28/a373/jo">exempt</a>, unless their content is necessary for active administrative processes. A forthcoming article will look at the accessibility of PDFs on the Grand Duchy's most frequently visited public websites.</p>
<p>Since 2020, the Information and Press Service has been offering <a href="https://fonction-publique.public.lu/fr/formation-developpement/catalogue-formations/secteur-etatique/04organisat/04-6-egalch/et_04-6-3-31.html">training in PDF accessibility</a> for the public sector. It is included in the INAP catalogue and is given several times a year.</p>
<p>In this context, the <a href="../rapdf1/index.html">PDF framework</a> aims to provide all the keys to enable each public authority to carry out its own audit of the digital accessibility of the office automation files it makes available to its users, and thus ensure that they are compliant.</p>
<p>To help you familiarise yourself with it, the "<a href="../rapdf1/methodologie.html">Methodology</a>" page invites you to download an archive containing a docx file, a second file which is the conversion of the first into PDF and a folder containing screenshots relating to each test that the criteria invite you to carry out.</p>
<p>This framework is based on the European standard <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf">EN 301 549 v 3.2.1</a>, more specifically chapter 10, "non-web documents", which applies to all PDF documents published on Luxembourg public websites. The criteria it contains are an adaptation of the WCAG success criteria for office documents.</p>
<p>Certain criteria and techniques from the European standard have been deliberately left out, either because they are irrelevant in the context of a PDF document (for example focus visibility), or because the use cases are too rare (for example, all the criteria relating to audio and video content integrated into a PDF, sound control, captioning, etc.)</p>
<p>Above all, the aim here is to ensure that everything checked can be done using the most common office tools (LibreOffice Writer, Microsoft Word, Adobe Reader, to name but a few). It was therefore decided to exclude <a href="../rapdf1/referentiel-technique.html#type-de-contenus-non-conformes">certain content and structures</a> from the analysis. Adobe Acrobat Pro software, even though it has a range of accessibility tools, is not necessary in the context of this framework.</p>
<p>So what are we going to test? What factors will influence the document's compliance? A total of <a href="../rapdf1/referentiel-technique.html#topic-1">46 criteria</a>, divided into ten themes, are being put under the microscope. Examples include the correct management of images conveying information, compliance with a minimum contrast, the presence of semantic logic in the structuring of tables, the relevance of link titles and, of course, the compliance of forms.</p>
<p>Experiment, test and <a href="../contact.html">let us know what you think</a>: this framework is not set in stone, and it will evolve as we incorporate feedback from your practices.</p>
<p>Last question worth asking: PDF or HTML? As we have seen, it is perfectly possible to produce a 100% accessible PDF. However, the complexity of producing accessible documents is greater in PDF, and updating them is less robust. It is possible to accompany the publication of any non-accessible PDF document with an accessible HTML document.</p>
