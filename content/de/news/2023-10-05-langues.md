<h2>The lang attribute, to make the page audible... and understandable</h2>
<h3>One of the simplest accessibility elements to implement is also one of the most overlooked.</h3>
<hr>
<div class="intro">
    <p>In Luxembourg perhaps more than anywhere else, it is not uncommon for the same HTML page to contain words in different languages. Nothing extraordinary: what you hear on the Knuedler is reflected on the Web.</p>
</div>

<p>While this cohabitation is perfectly possible, to ensure that the text is rendered as faithfully as possible by a screen reader, two things need to be taken into account:</p>
<h4>Define a main language for the page</h4>
<p>In the code, the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag should be located, i.e. the very first tag after the <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> declaration. Add the lang attribute to it. So, for a page written mainly or exclusively in French, the code will be: <code>&lt;html lang="fr"&gt;.</code></p>
<p>This is the perfect time to remember that the code for Luxembourgish is not "lu" - which corresponds to the <span lang="lu">Luba-Katanga</span> spoken in the Democratic Republic of Congo - but "lb".</p>
<h4>Specify each language change</h4>
<p>Next, in the body of the page, you'll need to tell the screen reader when the text changes language, for example by framing the passages written in another language within the paragraph, as follows: <code>&lt;p&gt;Of course, I don't like all his films, but he had the talent to adapt &lt;span class="en"&gt;The English Patient&lt;/span&gt; for the cinema in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
<p>If you use a CMS to edit your site, it's highly likely that it offers this kind of functionality. Where this is not the case in the default CMS, there are usually <span lang="en">plugins</span> to manage language changes.</p>
<h4>So you'll be doing a lot of users a favour</h4>
<p>Who will all this help? First and foremost, blind and partially-sighted people. They will have difficulty understanding the text rendered by the screen reader if it deciphers a text or part of a text in the wrong language. But other users, such as those with dyslexia, will also be able to use vocalisation systems. The same pitfalls on the road to comprehension threaten them if the language changes are not properly signposted.</p>
<p>Below is a one-minute video to show you how the same paragraph is rendered by the JAWS screen reader, without and then with the language change indications:</p>

    <h5>No indication of language change in the code</h5>
    <p><em>[The following text is read in a French voice.]</em></p>
    <p>Anyway," says Juliette, "it's either that or a joint venture. I'd advise her to look out for whistleblowers. She closes Night Flight, fixes her gaze on the photo of the Twin Towers and blurts out: what's going on, dear? Antoine is no longer a whistleblower. Who's going to be snooping around a Health Data Hub anyway? I protest: safety isn't a nice-to-have, it's a must-have. Once there were two knights and maidens. They'd walk together. Out in the gardens. In all kinds of weather.</p>
    <h5>[<span lang="en">heading level one]</span> With indication of language change in the code</h5>
    <p><em>[The following text is read mainly in French, but each English expression is read in English]</em></p>

<p>You can try your hand at this by using or editing the <a href="https://codepen.io/dnauroy/pen/vYvVPdO">code</a> on the codepen.io website, using the page from the video.</p>

<p>By taking care to mark up your text correctly, you will tick no less than four criteria on the list of elements to be respected to have an accessible site: </p>
<ul>
    <li>8.<a href="../../fr/rgaa4.1.2/criteres.html#crit-8-3">3: your page has a default language</a>;</li>
    <li>8.<a href="../../fr/rgaa4.1.2/criteres.html#crit-8-4">4: the language code defined for the page is relevant</a>;</li>
    <li>8.<a href="../../fr/rgaa4.1.2/criteres.html#crit-8-7">7: each language change is indicated in the source code</a>;</li>
    <li>8.<a href="../../fr/rgaa4.1.2/criteres.html#crit-8-8">8: the language code for each language change is valid and relevant</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>And yet, in the audits regularly carried out by the <a href="https://sip.gouvernement.lu/fr.html">Information and Press Department</a> on a selection of public sites, while the language attribute defined at page level is almost never missing, language changes within the body of the page are very rarely indicated.</p>

<h4>By the way... is my word in the dictionary?</h4>

<p>Conversely, be careful to use the <code>lang</code> attribute only when necessary. Some words borrowed from English are now found in French dictionaries. Planning is one of them. In a page written in French, it is therefore not necessary to specify it in the code. If in doubt, consult the official dictionaries for languages frequently used on Luxembourg public sites:</p>

<ul>
    <li>for <a href="https://lod.lu/" lang="lb">Lëtzebuergesch: Lëtzebuerger Online Dictionnaire (LOD</a> ) (using <a href="https://spellchecker.lu/">spellchecker.</a> lu may help to detect words missing from the dictionary);</li>
    <li>for French: <a href="http://atilf.atilf.fr/tlfi.htm">Trésor de la Langue Française informatisé</a>;</li>
    <li>for German: <a href="https://www.dwds.de/" lang="de">Digitales Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache</a>;</li>
    <li>for English: <a href="https://www.oed.com/" lang="en">Oxford English Dictionary</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>To conclude, let's mention some reasons other than those strictly related to accessibility. Getting the language right will be a great help to online translation tools (think of the automatic page translation service provided by Google Chrome). We can also think of other flexible options: for example, third-party programmes included on the page (such as a video player) will display their navigation menu in the language specified on the page. Finally, on a purely stylistic note, hyphenation management via the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hyphens">hyphens</a> property is provided by the browser when you fill in the <code>lang</code> attribute for the languages supported by your browser.</p>
