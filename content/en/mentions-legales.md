The full IP address of the user is in no case kept. Only part of the IP address is kept in order to obtain overall statistics and in no case is it possible to identify a user.

This data is kept and hosted in Europe in a solution provided by a subcontractor, in particular the company Adobe Systems Inc., subject, as subcontractor, to the same legal obligations concerning the protection of personal data and this, for the case where such data were to be collected in the future.

The duration of data retention does not exceed that necessary to observe the evolution of audiences according to the evolution of browsers, resolutions used, or other statistical data available.

The person responsible for this processing is the Information and Press Service.
