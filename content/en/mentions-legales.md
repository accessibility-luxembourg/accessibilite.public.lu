### Protection of personal data

#### General information

Personal data provided by the user is processed in accordance with [Regulation (EU) 2016/679 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 27 April 2016](https://cnpd.public.lu/fr/legislation/droit-europ/union-europeenne/rgpd.html) on the protection of individuals with regard to the processing of personal data and on the free movement of data.

As the Information and Press Service does not collect any personal data apart from IP addresses in the logs of the website servers for security reasons, the user's consent is not required before visiting this website.

The person responsible for this processing is the Information and Press Service.

Users may lodge complaints regarding the protection of their data via the respective communication channels provided and with the party responsible, in this case the Information and Press Service. Users may also submit their complaints to the Data Protection Officer of the Information and Press Service at the following e-mail address: [dataprotection@sip.etat.lu](mailto:dataprotection@sip.etat.lu).

Users may also contact the [Commission nationale pour la protection des données](https://cnpd.public.lu/), whose registered office is at 1 Avenue du Rock'n'Roll, L-4361 Esch-sur-Alzette, for any dispute in this area.



#### Processing linked to audience measurement

Certain data relating to the user's hardware and software, which are not of a nature to identify the user, are collected when the user visits the public site. The sole purpose of this data collection is to obtain visitor statistics (browser type, resolution, approximate location, etc.) in order to provide users with the best possible service.

Under no circumstances is the user's full IP address kept. Only part of the IP address is kept in order to obtain overall statistics and under no circumstances is it possible to identify a user.

This data is stored and hosted in Europe in a solution provided by a subcontractor, in particular Adobe Systems Inc, which, as a subcontractor, is subject to the same legal obligations concerning the protection of personal data in the event that such data is collected in the future.

The duration of data retention does not exceed that required to observe changes in audiences as a function of changes in browsers, resolutions used or other available statistical data.

The person responsible for this processing is the Information and Press Service.
