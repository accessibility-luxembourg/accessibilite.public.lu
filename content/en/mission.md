The information and press service (SIP) is responsible at national level for monitoring the accessibility of public sites and mobile applications. The control procedure is defined in accordance with the [law of May 28, 2019](http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2019/05/28/a373/jo) as well as to [EU Implementing Decision 2018/1524](https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/FR/TXT/?uri=CELEX%3A32018D1524).

Inspections are carried out within the framework of inspection periods. The first control period began on September 23, 2020 and ends at the end of 2021. There is then one control period per calendar year.

There are three types of controls:

- **in-depth site audit**: this is a compliance audit based on the [RAWeb framework](../raweb1/index.html). The result of the audit allows us to know if the site is accessible and what possible accessibility problems are encountered.
- **simplified site audit**: the aim of this audit is to be able to detect non-conformities and raise awareness among the various stakeholders. It does not allow conformity to be assessed, but it can be carried out more quickly and therefore on a greater number of sites. The method is described on the page ["simplified control method"](./controle-simplifie.html).
- **mobile application audit**: this is a compliance audit based on the [RAAM framework](../raam1/index.html). The result of the audit allows you to know if the application is accessible and what possible accessibility problems are encountered.

The checks are carried out in several stages:

1. inventory all the sites and applications of the organizations covered by the law. [The inventory of public sites](https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/entreprises-des-sites-publics/) and [that of apps](https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/inventory-of-public-mobile-applications/) are available on the Open Data portal.
2. define the samples of sites and apps to control. It would indeed be unrealistic to want to test everything. The execution decision defines the number of tests to be carried out for each test category (for example for the period 2020-2021, the SIP must carry out 15 in-depth site audits, 87 simplified site audits and 2 mobile audits) This stage of Selection of sites and apps to test is carried out in consultation with the main players in the disability sector. [The sample for the period 2020-2021](https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/echantillon-pour-le-controle-de-laccessibilite-numerique-2020-2021/) is published on the portal open data.
3. carry out the audits. [The results of the audits](https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/audits-complets-de-laccessibilite-numerique/) are gradually published on the open data portal.
4. Preparation of a report for the European Commission based on the audit results. [The first report covering the period 2020-2021](https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/digital-accessibility-monitoring-report-2020-2021/) is available in open data. These reports are published every 3 years.
