*Version 1.1, published on 6 February 2026*

According to the [law of 28 May 2019](http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2019/05/28/a373/jo), all websites and mobile applications of Luxembourg public sector bodies must be accessible. The [Information and Press Service](https://sip.gouvernement.lu/en.html) is responsible for monitoring their compliance with accessibility requirements. Furthermore, the [law of 8 March 2023](https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2023/03/08/a133/jo) extends this obligation to certain types of products and services. Monitoring their accessibility is the responsibility of the [OSAPS](https://accessibilite-produits-services.public.lu/en.html).

In this context, the PDF framework has been developed to serve as a basis for evaluation and implementation for all public sector bodies in the scope of the law.

The RAPDF provides an operational framework for checking compliance with accessibility requirements. It can therefore be used to check that a PDF document complies with the criteria described in the European standard [EN 301 549 v.3.2.1](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf) for Section 10 *Non-web documents*.

It contains 46 control criteria.
