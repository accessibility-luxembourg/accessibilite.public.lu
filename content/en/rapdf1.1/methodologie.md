Unlike web content, where it is possible to inspect the source code to determine the presence of elements or attributes, it is difficult to do the same for documents in PDF format.
Inspecting the code of a document in PDF format can only be done using <span lang="en">Acrobat Pro</span>, which is a proprietary software package that requires training. 

This is why the chosen approach is to test the presence of certain elements using a dedicated tool (PAC).

For example, when the interface contains a graphic element conveying information, the criterion requires verification that an alternative is available and relevant, without giving any further details on the techniques to be used to provide an alternative to a graphic element. To help with the assessment, each criterion has a practical methodology (**which is non-normative**) setting out a possible method of assessing the criterion.

### Example resources

[Examples (zip file, 9.24 MB, in French)](/fr/files/ressources-rapdf1.zip) are available to illustrate the testing methodology. Each criterion is illustrated by a screen shot taken from the PAC tool.


### Assessment tools

To assess the criteria in the framework, the tests are carried out using the dedicated PAC tool or directly in the Acrobat Reader interface.

The section below describes the essential elements you need to know to install PAC.

#### PAC
Installation procedure

1. Download [PAC - The free PDF checker](https://pac.pdf-accessibility.org/en/download).
2. The download consists of a ZIP archive that needs to be unarchived. Right-click and choose "Extract all".
3. Then click on "PAC.exe" to launch the tool.

How to use the tool to perform the tests is described in detail in the testing methodology associated with each criterion in the framework.
