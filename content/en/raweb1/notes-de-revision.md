  --- title: RAWeb 1 revision notes --- RAWeb 1 is the first Luxembourg accessibility framework which covers all the requirements of the European standard EN 301 549 v3.2.1 currently in force. For all WCAG compatible criteria, RAWeb 1 is based on RGAA 4.1.2. The RGAA is published by DINUM on the site [accessibilite.numerique.gouv.fr](https://accessibilite.numerique.gouv.fr/) and the sources are available on this <a href="https://github .com/DISIC/accessibilite.numerique.gouv.fr/" rel="noreferrer noopener">GitHub repository</a>. RGAA 4.1.2 has its own [revision notes](../rgaa4.1.2/notes-revision.html). All other criteria are new and transcribe in the form of operational tests the criteria from the European standard EN 301 549 v3.2.1 which are not based on WCAG. These are the following criteria and themes: - [Criterion 4.14: For each time-based media that has a synchronized subtitle track or audio description, are the control functionalities of these alternatives presented at the same level than the main features?](criteria.html#crit-4-14) - [Criterion 4.15: For each feature that transmits, converts or records pre-recorded synchronized time-based media that has a subtitle track, resulting from the process, are the subtitles correctly preserved?](criteria.html#crit-4-15) - [Criterion 4.16: For each feature that transmits, converts or records pre-recorded time-based media with synchronized audio description , at the end of the process, is the audio description correctly preserved?](criteria.html#crit-4-16) - [Criterion 4.17: For each pre-recorded temporal media, the presentation of the subtitles is- can it be controlled by the user (except in special cases)?](criteria.html#crit-4-17) - [Criterion 4.18: For each pre-recorded synchronized time-based media that has synchronized translation subtitles, these can they be vocalized (except in special cases)?](criteria.html#crit-4-18) - [Criterion 13.13: For each conversion functionality of a document, the information relating to accessibility available in the source document are they preserved in the destination document (except in special cases)?](criteria.html#crit-13-13) - [Criterion 13.14: Each identification or control functionality which is based on the use of biological characteristics of does the user have an alternative method?](criteres.html#crit-13-14) - [Theme 14: Documentation and accessibility features](criteres.html#topic-14) - [ Theme 15: Editing tools](criteria.html#topic-15) - [Theme 16: Support services](criteria.html#topic-16) - [Theme 17: Real-time communication](criteria.html #topic-17) Glossary entries corresponding to these new criteria have been added: - [Help in creating accessible content](glossary.html#help-a-la-creation-de-accessible-content) - [Application bidirectional oral communication web](glossary.html#bidirectional-oral-communication-web-application) - [Biological characteristic](glossary.html#biological-characteristic) - [Essential characteristics of subtitles](glossary.html #essential-features-of-subtitles) - [Real-time written communication](glossary.html#real-time-written-communication) - [Documentation](glossary.html#documentation) - [Subtitle functionality accessibility](glossary.html#accessibility-functionality) - [Main functionalities (of a temporal media)](glossary.html#main functionalities-of-a-temporal-media) - [Voice functionalities](glossary. html#voice-features) - [Template](glossary.html#template) - [Timestamp (<em lang="en">time stamp</em>)](glossary.html#timestamp-time-stamp) - [ Accessibility information](glossary.html#accessibility-information) - [Mechanism that allows you to activate an accessibility feature](glossary.html#mechanism-that-allows-to-activate-an-accessibility-feature -accessibility) - [Editing tool](glossary.html#edition-tool) - [QVGA](glossary.html#qvga) - [Digital accessibility rules](glossary.html#accessibility-rules -numeric) - [Helpdesk](glossary.html#helpdesk) - [Relay service](glossary.html#relay-service) - [Translation subtitles](glossary.html #translation-subtitles) - [Transformation](glossary.html#transformation) - [Input unit](glossary.html#input-unit) ### Developments in content from RGAA 4.1.2 This This update is also accompanied by changes to the content resulting from RGAA 4.1.2. #### Introduction of the principle of non-interference A new section [&ldquo;Principle of non-interference&rdquo;&raquo;](../obligations.html#principle-of-non-interference) has been introduced into the page &ldquo;Bonds&nbsp;&rdquo; in order to fully comply with the EN 301 549 standard. In addition, each criterion included in the principle of non-interference is identified in the technical reference by the words &laquo;&nbsp;This criterion is subject to the principle of non-interference&nbsp;&raquo ;. #### Modification of the description of the sample for the audit of a website The section [&laquo;Sample for the audit of a website&nbsp;&raquo;](../obligations.html #Sample-for-audit-of-a-website) from the &ldquo;Obligations&rdquo; has been modified to take into account changes to the RAWeb criteria, in particular by introducing the obligation to evaluate the documentation of the website or help desk. #### Details concerning the compliance rate and the general methodology In the section [&laquo;&nbsp;Test of pages or screens&nbsp;&raquo;](../obligations.html#test-of-pages-or-screens) of the "Obligations" page, a note is added on the possible methods of managing content common to several pages of a sample: <blockquote> Certain criteria or themes are applicable to the entire site and not to a particular page, so there is no need to evaluate them on all pages in the sample. In this case, they can for example be evaluated on a single page of the sample and be considered not applicable on all other pages. This methodology for reporting the results of the evaluation of these criteria is of course optional. Regardless of the methodology chosen, there will be no impact on the overall compliance rate of the site. This is particularly the case for the following criteria and themes: - Criterion 12.3 “Is the “site map” page relevant? » - The theme “14. Documentation and accessibility features” - The theme “16. Support services” </blockquote> In the section [&laquo;&nbsp;Conformity rate to the standard&nbsp;&raquo;](.. /obligations.html#compliance-rate-with-the-standard) of the &ldquo;Obligations&nbsp;&raquo; page, any reference to &ldquo;average rate&rdquo; is deleted to refer only to the &ldquo;global rate&rdquo; as a reference rate, in particular for establishing the accessibility declaration. #### Modification of the Computer test environment The [Computer test environment] (environment.html) has been modified in order to comply with the evolution of browsers: - Internet Explorer has been removed, its support no longer exists. is no longer provided by Microsoft since 2022. - Chrome and Edge have been added. Edge now replaces Internet Explorer on Microsoft Windows; what's more, it has the same engine as Chrome. These choices are also supported by usage data, in particular: - the [WebAIM 2023] survey (https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey9/#browsercombos) which identifies Chrome and Edge as the most used browsers by blind or visually impaired people; - the 2023 evaluation of [browser market shares in Luxembourg by Statcounter GlobalStats](https://gs.statcounter.com/browser-market-share/all/luxembourg/2023). Thus, there is only one Computer test environment with 3 combinations. #### Removal of WCAG criterion from parsing The WCAG working group has published an update to WCAG 2.1 on September 21, 2023</a> indicating that the <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#parsing">success criterion 4.1.1 <em lng="en">Parsing< /em></a> should henceforth always be considered compliant. Since RAWeb is a transposition of WCAG 2.1, this choice is applied to the corresponding criteria in RAWeb. Thus, the RAWeb criteria [8.1](criteria.html#crit-8-1) and [8.2](criteria.html#crit-8-2) are no longer to be tested and must always be considered compliant. The criteria are kept in the repository (to preserve the numbering of the criteria for the theme “Mandatory elements”) and are accompanied by a note. #### Removed references to `longdesc` attribute The `longdesc` attribute as a compliant method for criteria 1.6 and 1.7 is removed. Indeed, the `longdesc` attribute has been declared obsolete in the HTML5 specification. In addition, the support for the attribute is insufficient with regard to the test environment; we note in particular an absence of support in a mobile environment (Safari/iOS and Chrome/Talkback). In test [1.6.1](criteria.html#test-1-6-1), the following condition is removed: <q>There is a `longdesc` attribute which gives the address (URL) of a page or a location in the page containing the [detailed description](glossary.html#description-detailee-image)</q>. The test methodology is adapted accordingly. In the technical note for criterion [1.6](criteria.html#crit-1-6), the passage concerning the `longdesc` attribute is deleted: <blockquote> The <code>longdesc</code> attribute which constitutes a of the conditions of test 1.6.1 (and whose relevance is checked with test 1.7.1) is now considered obsolete by the current HTML specification. Verification of this attribute will therefore only be required for versions of the HTML specification prior to HTML 5. </blockquote> In test [1.7.1](criteria.html#test-1-7-1), the condition following is deleted: <q>The [detailed description](glossary.html#description-detailee-image) via the address referenced in the `longdesc` attribute is relevant</q>. The test methodology is adapted accordingly. In the glossary, the entry &laquo;&nbsp;[Detailed description (image)](glossary.html#detail-description-image)&raquo; is modified. The item <q>A `longdesc` attribute which contains the address of a page or a location in the page containing the detailed description</q> is deleted. #### Modification of test 4.4.1 The test [4.4.1](criteria.html#test-4-4-1) has been rewritten to specify the test elements, considered too implicit. Test 4.4.1 in RGAA 4.1.2: <blockquote>Test 4.4.1: For each pre-recorded synchronized time-based media having synchronized subtitles, are these subtitles relevant?</blockquote> It has been rewritten in RAWeb 1 to introduce 3 test conditions to check: <blockquote> - The subtitles are in the language of the video; - The subtitles are relevant; - Subtitles are correctly synchronized. </blockquote> ### Removal of references to obsolete technologies In the criteria, glossary and methodologies, references to Flash, Silverlight and Java are deleted due to the disappearance of these technologies. The elements of the repository impacted are as follows: - The methodology of criterion [4.7](criteria.html#crit-4-7): removal of the test <q>the passage of text is located outside the multimedia content player if the latter uses Flash technology</q>. - The glossary entry &ldquo;Controlled environment&rdquo; : references to Flash and Silverlight are deleted in the second list item <q>Supported technologies, their version and their activation (JavaScript, WAI-ARIA, Flash, Silverlight, etc.)</q>. - The glossary entry &ldquo;Non-temporal media&rdquo; : all references to Flash, Java and Silverlight as well as their properties are removed. - The glossary entry &ldquo;Time-based media (sound, video and synchronized type)&rdquo; : all references to Flash and its properties are removed. Note 1 is deleted: note 2 becomes note 1, and note 3 becomes note 2. #### Addition of new links to WCAG techniques and failures New WCAG techniques and failures are added in correspondence with certain RAWeb criteria . -
