*Version 1, published on 8 February 2024*

According to the [Luxembourg law of 28 May 2019](http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2019/05/28/a373/jo), all websites and mobile applications of Luxembourg public sector bodies must be accessible. 
The [Information and Press Service (SIP)](https://sip.gouvernement.lu/) is responsible for assessing their accessibility.

Within this framework, the Web Accessibility Evaluation Framework (RAWeb) has been defined as the accessibility framework for all public sector bodies affected by the law.

The RAWeb's technical method makes it possible to check that a web page - i.e. all HTML content (HTML4, XHTML1 and HTML5) - complies with the success criteria of [European standard EN 301 549 (.pdf)](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf) to establish the level of legal requirements in terms of digital accessibility.

The RAWeb technical method provides an operational framework for checking compliance with accessibility requirements.

It comprises 136 test criteria. Some tests refer to implementation techniques (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) to check that the criterion has been met, in order to reduce the margin of interpretation as to whether accessibility standards have been complied with.

If the framework is not updated within 3 years, and in order to take into account new standards or technical specifications, it is possible to create your own tests in addition to the existing ones.

Certain tests, in particular those concerning user interface components developed in JavaScript, require content to be rendered using assistive technologies associated with browsers and operating systems. The test environment (or "baseline") is described on the [Test environment](environment.html) page. 

The RAWeb technical method only covers Websites, native mobile applications are covered by [RAAM 1](../raam1/index.html).

The current version is version 1, and contains content from [RGAA 4.1.2](https://accessibilite.numerique.gouv.fr/). This framework has been adapted by the [Service information et presse (SIP)](https://sip.gouvernement.lu/) to refer to the Luxembourg legal framework. The sources are available on the GitHub repository [accessibility-luxembourg/ReferentielAccessibiliteWeb](https://github.com/accessibility-luxembourg/ReferentielAccessibiliteWeb).
