*Version 1, released February 8, 2024*

According to the [Luxembourg law of May 28, 2019](http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2019/05/28/a373/jo), all websites and mobile applications of Luxembourg public sector organizations must be accessible.
The [Information and Press Service (SIP)](https://sip.politique.lu/) is responsible for evaluating their accessibility.

In this context, the Web accessibility assessment framework (RAWeb) has been defined as an accessibility framework for all public sector organizations concerned by the law.

The RAWeb technical method makes it possible to verify that a web page – that is to say any HTML content (HTML4, XHTML1 and HTML5) – complies with the success criteria of [European standard EN 301 549 (.pdf) ](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf) to establish the level of legal requirements in terms of digital accessibility.

The RAWeb technical method provides an operational framework for verifying compliance with accessibility requirements.

It includes 136 control criteria. Some tests refer to implementation techniques (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc.) to verify that the criterion is respected in order to reduce the margin of interpretation regarding compliance with accessibility standards.

If the repository has not been updated within 3 years, and in order to take into account new standards or technical specifications, it is possible to create your own tests in addition to existing ones.

Certain tests, particularly concerning interface components developed in JavaScript, require checking the rendering of content with assistive technologies associated with browsers and operating systems. The test environment (or “Baseline”) is described on the [Test Environment](environment.html) page.

The RAWeb technical method only covers websites, native mobile applications are covered by [RAAM 1](../raam1/index.html).

This version is version 1, and contains content from [RGAA 4.1.2](https://accessibilite.numerique.gouv.fr/). This framework has been adapted by the [Information and Press Service (SIP)](https://sip.politique.lu/) to refer to the Luxembourg legal framework. The sources are available on the GitHub repository [accessibility-luxembourg/ReferentielAccessibiliteWeb](https://github.com/accessibility-luxembourg/ReferentielAccessibiliteWeb).
