title: Contiguous background color and contiguous color
---

Contiguous Background Color: Background color directly in contact with the outer edge of the interface component or [graphic element](#graphic-element).

Examples:

- For a white button with a blue border on a white background, the white background outside the blue border matches the contiguous background color;
- For a red button on a white background, the white background outside the red matches the contiguous background color;
- For a white button with a green border that turns black on focus and hover, the white background outside the green border of the default state and the black border of the state on hover and in focus matches the contiguous background color.

Contiguous Color: A color directly in contact with another color.
Example in a “no entry” sign, the red of the sign is the color adjacent to the white line in the center of the sign.

Note 1: in the case of the presence of a gradient, it is the least contrasting contiguous color of the gradient which will be considered as the contiguous color or contiguous background color.

Note 2: in the case of the presence of several colors, all of the colors will be considered as contiguous color or contiguous background color.
