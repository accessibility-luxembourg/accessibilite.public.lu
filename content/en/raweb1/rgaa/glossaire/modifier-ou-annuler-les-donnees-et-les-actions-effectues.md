title: Modify or cancel data and actions performed
---

Processes by which a user can modify the data he has entered, cancel his entry or cancel the actions resulting from his entry, for example cancel an order or a bank transfer.

Note: The page containing a form which modifies or deletes data, or which transmits answers to a test or exam, or whose validation has financial or legal consequences, must explicitly indicate the duration during which the user can request the cancellation of its seizure. It must also contain the procedure to be carried out to cancel this entry. This procedure does not necessarily have to be carried out online although it remains recommended.
