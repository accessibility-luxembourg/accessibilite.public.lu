title: Reading direction
---

Indicates the reading direction of the document or a passage of text via the `dir` attribute, `dir="ltr"`, for example. The two recognized values are:

- `ltr` (<span lang="en">left to right</span>) indicates a reading direction from left to right;
- `rtl` (<span lang="en">right to left</span>) indicates a reading direction from right to left.

Note: in the absence of indication of reading direction via the `dir` attribute on the `html`, `body` element, or one of the parents of the analyzed text, the default reading direction is from left to right (`ltr` value).
