title: Complex gestures and simple gestures
---

A simple gesture involves touching a single point on the screen. It can be a single press or click, a double press or double click, a long press.

A complex gesture can be both a gesture involving several points of contact on the screen (example: a gesture with two fingers on the screen to zoom in or out of a map) and a gesture based on following a trajectory on the screen (example: JavaScript function allowing detection of the movement of a finger to the left or right on a touch surface to trigger the passage to the previous/next item in a carousel).
