Image displaying text.

Note: It is not recommended to use text images. When it is possible to reproduce the same effects in CSS, the {% crit 1.8 %} requires that the text be reproduced in CSS text, or that a replacement mechanism allows the user to replace these images with [text styled](#text-style) in CSS.
