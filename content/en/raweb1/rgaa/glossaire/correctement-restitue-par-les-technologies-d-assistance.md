When a criterion, a test or a test condition requires verification of the restitution of a device, it must be ensured that said restitution is compatible with accessibility.

The test consists of verifying that the restitution is relevant for at least one of the combinations of the test environment (or "baseline") used to declare that an element, a device or an alternative is "compatible with accessibility ".

For example: the {% test '1.3.8' %} asks to verify that the alternative of a bitmap image (`<canvas>` tag) carrying information is correctly rendered.

We then carry out a test with the tools of the test environment defined for the site.

If we see that the alternative is correctly reproduced, the test is validated.
