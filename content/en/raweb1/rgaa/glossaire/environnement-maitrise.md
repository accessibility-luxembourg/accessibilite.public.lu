title: Controlled environment
---

Any environment in which access to information, technologies, conditions of use and user profiles can be known and controlled. The main elements that are essential to master are:

- The type and version of browsers;
- Supported technologies, their version and their activation (JavaScript, WAI-ARIA, etc.);
- Assistive technologies and any devices used specifically by disabled users;
- Supported operating systems and accessibility APIs;
- Training users of assistive technologies in the use of any particular device (interface, online application, etc.).

Authors and administrators must guarantee the compatibility of the technologies used and their uses by users and their technologies (including assistive technologies). Information services or websites, whatever their status, which provide public access cannot be considered controlled environments.
