title: Language code
---

Code of 2 characters (ISO 639-1) or 3 characters (ISO 639-2 and following) used to indicate the language of a document or a passage of text. The language code indication consists of two parts separated by a hyphen like `lang="[code]-[option]"`.

- [code] represents a valid language code of 2 or 3 characters;
- [option] is an indication left to the discretion of the author.

When a country code is used as an option, it can be used to indicate a regionalization of the language, the indication “en-us” indicates the American language, for example. The indication of the language code only concerns the [code] part before the hyphen.
