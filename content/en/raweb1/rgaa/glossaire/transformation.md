title: Transformation
---

Process managed automatically by the editing tool. There are two types of transformation:

- content restructuring: transformation during which the input technology (e.g. HTML, XML, etc.) is not modified in the output, the restructuring only modifies elements of the markup. For example: table linearization, splitting a document into several pages.
- content recoding: transformation during which the input technology is modified in the output (e.g. HTML to XHTML, HTML to PDF). This concerns in particular the editing zones which use a syntax different from that which will be used for public display.
