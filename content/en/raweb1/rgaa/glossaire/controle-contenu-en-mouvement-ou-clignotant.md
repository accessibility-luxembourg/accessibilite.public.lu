title: Control (moving or flashing content)
---

Ability for the user to control the display or playback of moving or flashing content by keyboard and mouse, at least.

All moving content, with the exception of temporal media supported by the multimedia theme, is concerned: animated images (for example an animated gif), moving content offered via a `<object>` tag, JavaScript code or CSS effects for example.

Note 1: Where appropriate, the control method should be available as the first element on the page.

Note 2: The method of controlling moving or flashing content must allow the user to interact with the rest of the page. Consequently, stopping or pausing via an event triggered only when the focus is taken does not validate the criterion.

Note 3: In some cases, the movement is an integral part of the component and it is not possible to give control to the user, for example a progress bar whose function is to indicate progress with a movement of an event such as a download. In this case the criterion is Not Applicable.
