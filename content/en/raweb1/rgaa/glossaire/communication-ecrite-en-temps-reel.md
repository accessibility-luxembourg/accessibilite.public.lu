title: Written communication in real time
---

Real-time written communication (<span lang="en">Real-time text</span>, RTT) is a mode of written communication that allows interlocutors to read the text being written by the sender , without waiting for the sender to validate (for example with the <kbd>enter</kbd> key).

Collaborative editing tools (for example, online office suites) are an example of the operating principle of written communication in real time: the different stakeholders can see the texts written and modified by each at the very moment of application. modifications to the texts. This operation is very different from a common online conversation system (such as instant messaging), which only transmits a written message to the interlocutors upon activation of a key or button (for example, the key <kbd>entry</kbd>).
