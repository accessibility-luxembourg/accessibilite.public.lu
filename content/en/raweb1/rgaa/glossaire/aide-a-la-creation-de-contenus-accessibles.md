title: Help with creating accessible content
---

Any device available from a content editing interface, whatever the destination format, which supports the author of the content in taking into account digital accessibility rules.

Help for creating accessible content can be an automatic help tool or documentation. Help for content creation includes:
- automatic or semi-automatic tests available from the editing functionalities;
- other automatic tools (a <i lang="en">chatbot</i> for example);
- documentation that explains how to set accessibility properties for each content element;
- manual tests available from the editing features to guide authors in detecting errors.
