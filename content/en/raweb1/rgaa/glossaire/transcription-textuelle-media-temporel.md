title: Text transcription (temporal media)
---

Textual content associated with time-based media using the appropriate technique (text coded in HTML or in a text file found on the same page or viewable following a link). This content gives the user access (independently from viewing the multimedia object) to:

- The totality of what is expressed orally;
- All descriptive information necessary for an equivalent understanding of the action.

This textual information must be presented in the chronological order of its appearance in the temporal media.

Note: the verbatim transcription must be outside the `<object>` tag.
