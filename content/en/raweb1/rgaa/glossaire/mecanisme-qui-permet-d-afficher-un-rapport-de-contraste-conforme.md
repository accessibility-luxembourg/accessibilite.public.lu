title: Mechanism for displaying a conforming contrast ratio
---

Interface component whose activation allows you to modify the appearance of the site or page so as to display the content with a sufficient contrast ratio. The design of this interface component must comply with {% crit 3.2 %} and {% crit 3.3 %} without itself using a mechanism to display a compliant contrast ratio. This mechanism must keep the contents and functionalities of the site or page that it modifies identical.
