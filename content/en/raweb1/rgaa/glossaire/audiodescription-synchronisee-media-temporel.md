title: Synchronized audio description (time-based media)
---

Narration added (via a sound file) to a sound track to describe important visual details that cannot be understood from the main sound track alone. The audio description must be synchronized with the time-based media by an application device linked to the player itself or provided by the development, for example with JavaScript.

Note 1: Audio description of a video provides information about actions, characters, scene changes, on-screen text, and other visual content.

Note 2: In standard audio description, narration is added during pauses that exist in the dialogue. (See also extended audio description.)

Note 3: when all the information in the video is already given in the audio track, no additional audio description is required.
