For character-by-character input, the smallest text entry unit is the character.

For a system that has word prediction functionality, the smallest input unit is the word.

For some voice recognition systems, text is not transcribed until an entire word or sentence has been spoken. In this case, the smallest input unit is the word or phrase.
