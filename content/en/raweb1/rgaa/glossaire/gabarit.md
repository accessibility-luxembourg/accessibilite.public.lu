A template is a document format that has predefined parameters. It is used to insert content edited by the author. A template has presentation parameters, usage parameters or even technical parameters that are not perceptible.

A template can concern an entire page (home page template, etc.) or specific types of content (forms, images, videos, etc.)

A set of templates is a group of templates that allow different formatting of the same element. For example :

- templates for the application home screen;
- templates for screens containing interactive elements;
- templates for creating a PDF.
