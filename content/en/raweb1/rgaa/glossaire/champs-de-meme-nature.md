title: Fields of the same nature
---

In a form, set of fields that can be grouped by the nature of the expected information. Grouping aims to identify fields that should be treated as a set.

Some examples :

- Three successive fields to enter a date (day/month/year);
- Successive fields for a telephone number;
- A block intended to enter the identity and address of the user, when the form contains several contact blocks;
- A set of radio buttons or checkboxes that relate to a question.

These fields should be grouped when the label titles are not sufficient to inform the user that the fields are part of a grouping.
