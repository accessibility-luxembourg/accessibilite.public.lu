---

Image having no function and not conveying any particular information in relation to the content with which it is associated.

Examples:

- An image preceding each item in a list;
- An image used to support the layout;
- A rounded corner image to decorate a block of information;
- An illustrative image providing no information necessary for understanding the text with which it is associated.

Note: tags with a WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute can only act as a decoration image if they have a WAI-ARIA `aria-hidden="true"` attribute.
