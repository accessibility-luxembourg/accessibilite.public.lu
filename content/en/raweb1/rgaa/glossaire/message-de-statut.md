title: Status message
---

A status message informs the user of a change in content on the page without interrupting their main activity (there is no change of context, for example a repositioning of focus on the message).

A status message can inform about:

- The success or result of an action;
- The busy state of an application;
- The progress status of a process;
- The existence of error.
