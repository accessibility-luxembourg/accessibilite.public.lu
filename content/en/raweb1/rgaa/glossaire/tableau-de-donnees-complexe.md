title: Complex data table
---

A data table is a structure introduced by a `<table>` tag or when correctly rendered by assistive technologies by a tag with a WAI-ARIA `role="table"` attribute.

When a data table contains headers that are not distributed only on the first row and/or first column of the grid or whose scope is not valid for the entire column or row , we are talking about a complex data table. It is then necessary to provide a “summary” to explain its nature and structure in order to facilitate consultation for users of assistive technologies, for example.
