title: Non-time-based media
---

Content that does not unfold over time, viewable via `svg` and `canvas` elements; for example, an interactive animation made with a `canvas` tag. Non-time-based media can contain time-based media (a slideshow created with `canvas` which offers a list of videos to view, for example).
