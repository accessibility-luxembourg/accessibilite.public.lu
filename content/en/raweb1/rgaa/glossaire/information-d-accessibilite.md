title: Accessibility information
---

Accessibility information is all the information (attributes, programmatic relationships, alternatives, etc.) necessary to make content accessible. For example: the alternative of a graphic element, the semantics of a passage of text, the title of an inline frame...

For example, in HTML, the `alt` attribute of an image is accessibility information.

An editing tool should have features that allow you to define all the information needed to create accessible content, for example:

- be able to define the alternative of an image or, on the contrary, be able to declare it decorative;
- be able to define section titles;
- be able to define the language of a passage of text;
- be able to define labels for form fields.

All accessibility criteria relating to the targeted content technology are affected. For example, for an HTML page, all RAWeb level A and AA criteria must be respected. For the creation of a document in PDF format, these are all the criteria of the [reference for evaluating the accessibility of documents in PDF format (RAPDF)](../rapdf1/index.html) at level A and AA which must be able to be respected.
