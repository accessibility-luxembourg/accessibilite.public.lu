title: Test image
---

Image used in a test, captcha or an image used as a test in a quiz or game.

Example: a series of images presents a detail from famous paintings; you must recognize the title and the painter of each painting. In this situation, it is not possible to give a relevant alternative (for example the name of the painting and/or the painter) without rendering the test unusable. The alternative must then be content to give the possibility of identifying the image, for example “image 1 of the test”.
