title: Information (given by color)
---

Information transmitted visually through color. The indication that fields in red are mandatory in a form, the use of a blue background to indicate the page currently being viewed in a menu with a green background, the change of color of an article name to indicating its unavailability in a list of articles are all examples of an indication given by color.

When information given by color is accompanied by another method intended for users who do not see or perceive colors or their associations poorly, the criterion will be considered not applicable.

Ways of transmitting information other than through color can be:

- A visible textual indication;
- A means involving graphics (pictogram, background image, shape, different border style, etc.) and through a complement at the code level (`aria-label`, `title`, hidden text, `aria-current`, etc.);
- Another typographic style (bold, italic, text size, other font, etc.) and through a code level complement (`aria-label`, `title`, hidden text, `aria-current` , etc.).
