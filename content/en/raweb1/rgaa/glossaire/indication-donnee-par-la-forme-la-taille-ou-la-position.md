This could be, for example:

- The presence of a visual marker, to indicate the active page in a navigation menu (indication given by the position);
- A foreground to indicate an active tab (indication given by the shape);
- A modification of the font size in a tag cloud (indication given by the size).

Or any other similar graphic effect.
