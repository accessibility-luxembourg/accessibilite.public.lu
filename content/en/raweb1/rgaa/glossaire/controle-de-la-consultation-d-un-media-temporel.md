title: Control of consultation (of a time-based media)
---

Possibility for the user to control the consultation of a time-based media by the keyboard and any pointing device, at least. The following points must be observed:

- List of mandatory consultation control features:
  - The multimedia object must always have the following functionalities, at a minimum: play, pause or stop;
  - If the media object has sound, it must have sound on/off functionality;
  - If the multimedia object has non-embedded subtitles, it must have functionality to control the appearance/disappearance of subtitles;
  - If the multimedia object has an audio description, it must have functionality to control the appearance/disappearance of the audio description.
- Each functionality must be accessible by the keyboard, via the tab key, and by any pointing device at least.
- Each functionality must be activated by the keyboard and by any pointing device, at least.

Note: If there is no sound on a time-based media, it is not useful to put a sound on/off feature. If this functionality is however present and it requires a textual alternative to be understood by certain users, then it must be given one since the user is likely to access it and want to activate it.
