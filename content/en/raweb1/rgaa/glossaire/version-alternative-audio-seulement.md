title: Alternative “audio only” version
---

An “audio only” version is a sound version, in the form of a simple file in MP3 format for example, used as an alternative to a video only (video without sound information). The only users impacted by accessibility being blind people, who cannot see the video, <abbr lang="en" title="web content accessibility guidelines">WCAG</abbr> considers it acceptable to offer an alternative sound version.

The “audio only” version must contain all important visual information from the video.

Generally it is simpler to produce an audio version than a textual version when the video is very descriptive (the textual transcription often requires significant editorial work). It is recalled, however, that only the textual transcription ensures universal access to the information broadcast by the video, in the event that a user is not able to start the video for example.
