Note 1: A functional avoidance or quick access link is a link whose activation allows reading and keyboard navigation to be resumed from the target of the link when using the browsers and technical aids retained in the testing environment (or “baseline”) of the audit.

Note 2: avoidance or quick access links must be located in the same place in the presentation and in the same relative order in the source code in order to satisfy {% crit 12.2 %}.
