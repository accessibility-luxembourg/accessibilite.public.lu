title: Editing tool
---

Web application or editing component present in a web page allowing you to create or modify content intended to be distributed to other users. An editing tool can be used by one or more users working collaboratively.

An editing tool can be:

- the tool as delivered by the publisher;
- the tool augmented with extensions not developed by the publisher;
- a set of tools.

Examples of editing tools:

- application allowing you to edit and control the content of websites or applications, for example, CMS (<em lang="en">Content Management System</em>), LMS (<em lang="en"> Learning Management System</em>), LCMS (<em lang="en">Learning Content Management System</em>), content aggregator;
- application for creating office documents (for example for distribution in PDF format);
- multimedia editing tools;
- application allowing the creation of web applications;
- application allowing code editing;
- application allowing export to web technology format (for example, software that allows saving in HTML);
- application that generates content based on templates, scripts, command line, etc. ;
- application or functionality of a web page allowing the editing of portions of web pages or applications (typically, blog systems, commenting functionalities on websites, forums or even wiki systems);
- mail application allowing you to send <em lang="en">emails</em>.

Examples of editing tools that are not included in scope:

- An application whose created content is not made available to other users (note-taking application without sharing functionality for example). In this case, the edited content is only available to the owner and is not made available to other users.
- Forms for users. For example, an order form for an e-commerce application. Although the forms allow content to be edited, this content is not made available to other users.
- Independent accessibility control tools: these tools do not modify the content they control.

Editing tools should not be systematically integrated into the sample. For example, when auditing a news website, RAWeb does not require that the publishing tool (for example a CMS) which allows the content to be created, is itself audited. If the purpose of the audit is to evaluate the public consultation interface, the sample should only contain representative public pages, but not the content management tool.
