title: Compatible with assistive technologies
---

Content or functionality must be compatible with users' assistive technologies as well as with the accessibility features of browsers and other user agents via an accessibility API.

This concerns, at the same time, the technology, its functionalities and its uses:

- The way web technology is used must be compatible with users' assistive technologies. This means that the way the technology is used has been tested for interoperability with assistive technology users in the language(s) of the content;
- The technology works natively in widely distributed user agents that are, themselves, accessibility-compatible (such as HTML and CSS) or with a widely distributed plug-in that is, itself, accessibility-compatible 'accessibility.

Verifying compatibility with assistive technologies requires carrying out a number of tests specific to the technology used, for example:

- Check the name, role, configuration and state changes of the interface components;
- Check that the rendering of an interface component is correct for the assistive technology(s) used.
