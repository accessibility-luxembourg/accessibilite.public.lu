title: Set of pages
---

Web pages linked to each other by links and constituting a coherent whole within a website. For example, the pages of a specific section, the pages of a blog, the administration pages of a customer account are all sets of pages.

Note: the home page of a website can constitute, in itself, a “set of pages” due to its uniqueness.
