title: Set of pages
---

Web pages linked together to form a coherent set of pages within a website. For example, the pages of a specific section, the pages of a blog or the administration pages of a customer account are all sets of pages.

Note: the home page of a website can, on its own, constitute a "set of pages" because of its uniqueness.
