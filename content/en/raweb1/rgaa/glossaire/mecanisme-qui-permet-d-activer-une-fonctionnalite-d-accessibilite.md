title: Mechanism for enabling an accessibility feature
---

Interface component or set of interface components making it possible to activate a functionality which takes into account one or more adaptation needs of the interface. For example: a button to display a page with consistent contrasts or a button to increase paragraph spacing.

We also speak of a **set of components** when in certain interfaces, the component which enables the functionality is only made available following the prior necessary activation of one or more other components. For example: a button allows you to display a modal window which itself contains a button which allows you to display a page with consistent contrasts. In this case, the button that displays the modal window **and** the button to activate the display of conformal contrasts together constitute the mechanism.

This mechanism must keep the contents and functionalities of the site or page that it modifies identical.
