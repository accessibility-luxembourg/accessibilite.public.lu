title: Essential features of subtitles

---

It is possible to apply presentation effects to subtitles (text color, style, font) in order to convey information to users (for example identify the person speaking). These characteristics are essential for the understanding of subtitles by users and should be preserved during the transformation processes (sending or recording the video for example) if they are present.
