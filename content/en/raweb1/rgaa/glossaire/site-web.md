---

Set of all web pages:

- Connected by web links;
- Belonging to the same domain name (e.g.: design.numerique.gouv.fr);
- Which constitute a coherent whole from the user's point of view.

Special case of web pages of a subdomain; a subdomain can:

- Either belong to the website attached to the domain name, if the user has a coherent perception of it with the other pages of the website (for example: same structure, same navigation, etc.);
- Either not belonging to the website attached to the domain name (for example: different blogs in the subdomain of a domain name and not related to each other).
