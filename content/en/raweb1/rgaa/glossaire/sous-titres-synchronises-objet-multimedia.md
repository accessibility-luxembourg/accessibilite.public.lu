title: Synchronized subtitles (media object)
---

Text of audio information (words of a character, important noise to understand the action, etc.) present in a time-based media and displayed synchronously with the flow of the multimedia object.

Note 1: to differentiate sound sources (different characters, voice-overs, etc.), it is recommended to use an appropriate mechanism (putting in square brackets, italics, explicit announcement such as “voice-over: …”).

Note 2: subtitling for translation (`kind="subtitles"` attribute of the `<track>` tag in HTML5, for example) should not be confused with subtitling for the deaf and hard of hearing (attribute ` kind="captions"` of the `<track>` tag in HTML5, for example). These two types of subtitling pursue different goals. Only the presence and relevance of subtitling for the deaf and hard of hearing allows compliance.
