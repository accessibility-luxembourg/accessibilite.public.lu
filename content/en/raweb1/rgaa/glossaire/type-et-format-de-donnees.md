title: Data type and format
---

Indication of the type and format of data expected when entering a form field. For example :

- Date (dd/mm/yyyy);
- Amount in Euros ;
- Postal code (5 digits: e.g. 75001).

Important note: when the form field type offers an input mask, for example the `date` or `time` fields, the format indication is not necessary.
