title: Tab order
---

Order in which focus moves (to a next element or to a previous element). The natural order is that which is implemented via source code. When modified by use of the `tabindex` attribute or by use of a JavaScript command, the modified order is taken into account.

Warning: when an element initiates a change in the page (change of context, management of hidden areas, addition of content, management of form fields, etc.) it is necessary to activate the element which initiates the change to test consistency of the tab order.
