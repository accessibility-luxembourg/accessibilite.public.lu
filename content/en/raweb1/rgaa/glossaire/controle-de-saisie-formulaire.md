title: Input control (form)
---

Set of processes that alert the user of mandatory fields, indications of expected type or format and entry errors in a form. These input controls can be implemented by the content author or rely on attributes (like `required` or `pattern`), WAI-ARIA attributes (like `aria-required`) or field types that automatically produce input or error indications (such as the `url`, `email`, `date`, `time` types for example).
