title: Interface component
---

An interface component is an element with which the user can interact, for example a button, a link, an input box. Some components can be more complex such as a menu, a dialog window, a tab system. Finally, an interface component can be based on native HTML elements or developed from scratch in JavaScript and WAI-ARIA attributes. Particularly for elements with WAI-ARIA attributes corresponding to a [design pattern](#design-pattern) it is recommended to consider the document <span lang="en">[WAI-ARIA 1.1 Authoring Practices] (http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/)</span> during their implementation.
