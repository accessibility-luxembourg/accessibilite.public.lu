title: Title

HTML element (`h` tag) with 6 hierarchy levels (from `h1` for the most important title to `h6` for the least important) or HTML element having the WAI-ARIA attributes `role="heading"` and `aria-level` allowing you to structure the information in web content.

Ensuring a strict hierarchy between the titles of a web page is a good practice, but the presence of hierarchical breaks does not invalidate the criterion as long as this looser hierarchy remains consistent (a title `<h3>` can thus come directly after a title `<h1>`, for example). The title hierarchy does not have to contain a `<h1>` title. Although these practices are not encouraged, they do not invalidate the criterion.

Note: Titles visually hidden via CSS are considered present and validate {% crit 9.1 %}.
