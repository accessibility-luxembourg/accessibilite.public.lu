title: Responsive image
---

- Client-side responsive image (`usemap` attribute): image divided into clickable or neutral areas (`nohref` attribute);
- Server-side responsive image (`ismap` attribute): image for which the browser transmits the pointer coordinates to the server, each set of coordinates corresponding to a resource (web page). Server-side responsive image is extremely rare.

Note: in HTML5, the `ismap` attribute is obsolete and non-compliant for `image` type buttons (`input type="image"`).
