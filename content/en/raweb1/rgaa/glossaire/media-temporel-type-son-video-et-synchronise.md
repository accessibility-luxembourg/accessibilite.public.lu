title: Time-based media (sound, video and synchronized type)
---

* Audio-only temporal media: sound content (Wav, Mp3â€¦);
* Time-based media only video: images or photos in motion or sequence;
* Synchronized time-based media: an audio or video stream synchronized with another format to present information and/or with interactive temporal components. Time-based media can be accessed in 2 different ways:

- File to download which can be viewed with software external to the web page;
- Content embedded in the web page and viewable in the web page via:
  - The `<video>` element (for example a video);
  - The `<audio>` element (for example a podcast);
  - The `<svg>` element (for example a vector cartoon);
  - The `<canvas>` element (for example a cartoon in bitmap image);
  - The `<bgsound>` element to broadcast background sound to the web page.

Time-based media can be broadcast in real time or offered for playback asynchronously (pre-recorded media).

Note 1: animated gifs, image animations made by JavaScript or CSS are not considered temporal media.

Note 2: The `<bgsound>` element is specific to Internet Explorer and should not be used.
