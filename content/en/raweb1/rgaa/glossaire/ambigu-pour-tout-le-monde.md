title: Ambiguous for everyone

The intention cannot be determined from the link and all the information on the web page presented to the user at the same time as this link (i.e. a reader without functional limitations would not know the function of a link before activating it). Example: The word “guava” in the following sentence used as a link: “One of the important exports is guava.” This link could lead to a definition of guava, a graph showing a list of quantities of guavas exported, or a photo of people harvesting guava. Until the link is activated, any user is in uncertainty and a disabled person is therefore not at a disadvantage.
