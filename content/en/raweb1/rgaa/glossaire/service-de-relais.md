title: Relay service
---

Relay services allow users, regardless of their mode of communication (text, signs, speech) to interact in real-time remote communication with other participants, providing conversion between modes of communication.

For example: a user who communicates with sign language wants to communicate with someone who does not practice it, a relay service will provide live interpretation so that they can communicate.
