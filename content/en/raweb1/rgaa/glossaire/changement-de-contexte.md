title: Context switch
---

Major changes in the content of a web page which, if made without the user's awareness, can disorient the user who cannot see the entire page at once. Context switches include changes:

- user agent;
- restitution space;
- of focus;
- content that modifies the meaning of the web page.

Note: A change in content is not always a change in context. A change in content such as expanding a tree, a dynamic menu, or a tab move does not necessarily change the context unless it also changes one of the elements listed above (focus, e.g. ).

For example, opening a new window, moving focus to a different component, moving to a new page (including anything that would appear to the user to be moving to another page) or the significant reorganization of the content of a page are all illustrations of a change of context.
