title: Keyboard shortcut
---

A way to trigger an action associated with a user interface component by pressing one or more keys.

Note: <span lang="en">“Access keys”</span> (HTML attribute `accesskey`) are indeed keyboard shortcuts, but they are not affected by {% crit 12.10 %} insofar as their activation already requires the use of modification keys (variable depending on the browser).
