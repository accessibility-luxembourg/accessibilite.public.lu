title: Short and concise alternative

The conditions for rendering a textual alternative via assistive technologies (for example a screen magnifier) require that it be as short as possible. A maximum length of 80 characters is strongly recommended; it will limit the number of operations necessary to read the alternative by users of braille displays or screen magnifiers in particular.
