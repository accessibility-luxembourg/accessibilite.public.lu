title: Language change
---

Indication of language changes is necessary to indicate to assistive technologies to modify the vocal reproduction of an element. Language changes affect all content, including the values of certain attributes like `title`.

Note: it is not possible to indicate language changes in an attribute value itself, in this case the language change is indicated on the element that contains the attribute. For example, a link with a `title` in English must have an attribute `lang="en"`. When the attribute contains several passages of text in different languages, the criterion is not applicable.
