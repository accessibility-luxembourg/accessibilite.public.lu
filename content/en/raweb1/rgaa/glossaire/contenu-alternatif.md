title: Alternative content
---

Content replacing another providing the same information but which may be presented in a different way. This content can be textual but also itself structured using tags. Alternative content must meet all of the RAWeb criteria applicable to it to be considered an accessible alternative to the element it replaces. Example: A data table can be the alternative content of a bitmap image (`<canvas>` tag) displaying a statistical graph.
