title: Can the user deactivate motion detection to avoid accidental triggering of the functionality (except in particular cases)?
---

1. Find the functionalities available in the document by moving the device.
2. Check if the user can deactivate motion detection.
3. If so, for each feature, check that it cannot be triggered.
4. If this is the case for each functionality available by moving the device, **the test is validated**.
