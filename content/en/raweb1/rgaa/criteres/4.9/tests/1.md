title: For each [non-time-based media](#non-temporal-media) having an alternative, does that alternative provide access to the same content and similar functionality?
---

1. Find the non-time-based media associated with an alternative in the document.
2. For each non-time-based media, check that the alternative is relevant (it allows access to the same content and similar functionalities).
3. If this is the case for each non-time-based media, **the test is validated**.
