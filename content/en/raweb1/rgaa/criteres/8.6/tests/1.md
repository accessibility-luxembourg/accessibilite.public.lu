title: For each web page with a [page title](#page-title) (tag `<title>`), is the content of this tag relevant?
---

1. Find the structured title in the document using a `<title>` element.
2. Check whether the content of the `<title>` element is sufficiently relevant (it allows the page to be found in the browsing history or the list of tabs).
3. If it is, **the test is validated**.
