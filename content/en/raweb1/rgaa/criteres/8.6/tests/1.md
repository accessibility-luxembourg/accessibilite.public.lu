title: For each web page with a [page title](#page-title) (`<title>` tag), is the content of this tag relevant?
---

1. Find the structured title in the document using a `<title>` element.
2. Check if the content of the `<title>` element is sufficiently relevant (it allows you to find the page in the browsing history or the list of tabs).
3. If so, **the test is validated**.
