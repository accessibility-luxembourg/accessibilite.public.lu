title: The [helpdesk](#helpline) meets the communication needs of people with disabilities directly or through [a relay service](#relay-service). Has this rule been followed?
---

1. Identify the presence of a support service on the website.
2. If this is the case, check that the assistance service can be used by all people with disabilities. It may be helpful to search the website documentation to find this information. For example, if the support service is available from a telephone number, check that there are alternative means for users who have little or no access to oral language (deaf or hard of hearing people) or who cannot use verbal language (people with aphasia). For example :
- an email address or an online form;
- instant messaging;
- the provision of a simultaneous written or visual translation of oral or audio information, or the provision of a sign language interpreter (use of a relay service).
3. If so, the test is validated.
