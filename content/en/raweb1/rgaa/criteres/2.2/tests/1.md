title: For each frame (tag `<iframe>` or `<frame>`) with a `title` attribute, is the content of this attribute relevant?
---

1. Find the frames in the document (element `<iframe>` or `<frame>`).
2. For each frame with a `title` attribute, check that its content is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each frame, **the test is validated**.
