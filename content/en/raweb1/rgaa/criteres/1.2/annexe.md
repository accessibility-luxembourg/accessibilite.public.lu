#### Technical note

When an image is associated with a [caption](#image-caption), the WCAG technical note recommends systematically providing a [text alternative](#textual-image-alternative) (see criterion 1.9). In this case criterion 1.2 is not applicable.

In the case of a decorative vector image (`<svg>` tag) which would be displayed through a `<use href="â€¦">` child element of the `<svg>` element, the test 1.2.4 will also apply to the `<svg>` element associated through the `<use>` element.

A WAI-ARIA `role="presentation"` attribute can be used on decoration images and non-clickable decoration areas. The `"none"` role introduced in ARIA 1.1 and synonymous with the `"presentation"` role can also be used. However, it is still preferable to use the `"presentation"` role while waiting for satisfactory support from the `"none"` role.
