title: Does each [non-clickable area](#non-clickable-area) (`<area>` tag without `href` attribute) [decoration](#decoration-image) check one of these terms ?
steps:
  - The `<area>` tag has an empty `alt` attribute (`alt=""`) and is devoid of any other attribute to provide a [textual alternative](#textual-alternative-image).
  - The `<area>` tag has a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"` or `role="presentation"`.
---

1. Find the decorative images structured in the document using a `<area>` element (without `href` attribute).
2. For each image, check that the `<area>` element does not have `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label` or `title` attributes and that it has:
   - either an empty `alt` attribute (`alt=""`);
   - either a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"` or `role="presentation"`.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
