title: Does each bitmap image (`<canvas>` tag) [decoration](#decoration-image), without [caption](#image-caption), satisfy these conditions?
steps:
  - The `<canvas>` tag has a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"`.
  - The `<canvas>` tag and its children do not have [text alternative](#textual-alternative-image).
  - There is no text acting as a [text alternative](#textual-image-alternative) between `<canvas>` and `</canvas>`.
---

1. Find decorative images without captions in the document, structured using a `<canvas>` element.
2. For each image, check that the `<canvas>` element does not have `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label` or `title` attributes and that it:
   - has a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"`;
   - and is devoid of textual alternatives;
   - and is devoid of alternative content present between the `<canvas>` and `</canvas>` tags.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
