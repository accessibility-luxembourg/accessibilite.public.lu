title: Does each vector image (`<svg>` tag) [decoration](#decoration-image), without [caption](#image-caption), satisfy these conditions?
steps:
  - The `<svg>` tag has a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"`.
  - The `<svg>` tag and its children do not have [textual alternative](#textual-alternative-image).
  - The `<title>` and `<desc>` tags are missing or empty.
  - The `<svg>` tag and its children do not have a `title` attribute.
---

1. Find decorative images without captions in the document, structured using a `<svg>` element.
2. For each image, check that the `<svg>` element does not have `aria-labelledby` or `aria-label` attributes and that it:
   - has a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"`;
   - and is devoid of textual alternatives (as well as its child elements);
   - and does not contain `<title>` and `<desc>` elements unless empty of content;
   - and does not have a `title` attribute (as well as its child elements).
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
