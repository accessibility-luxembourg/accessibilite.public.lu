title: Each embedded image (tag `<embed>` with the attribute `type="image/…"`) [decoration](#decoration-image), without [caption](#image-caption ), does it verify these conditions?
steps:
  - The `<embed>` tag has a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"`.
  - The `<embed>` tag and its children do not have [textual alternative](#textual-alternative-image).
---

1. Find decorative images without captions in the document, structured using an `<embed>` element (with a `type="image/…"` attribute).
2. For each image, check that the `<embed>` element does not have `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label` or `title` attributes and that it:
   - has a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"`;
   - and is devoid of textual alternatives;
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
