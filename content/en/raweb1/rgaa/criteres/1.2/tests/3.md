title: Each [image object](#image-object) (tag `<object>` with the attribute `type="image/…"`) [decoration](#image-decoration), without [caption ](#image-caption), does it verify these conditions?
steps:
  - The `<object>` tag has a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"`.
  - The `<object>` tag has no textual alternative.
  - There is no text acting as a textual alternative between `<object>` and `</object>`.

1. Find structured decorative images without captions in the document using a `<object>` element (with a `type="image/…"` attribute).
2. For each image, check that the opening tag `<object>` does not have `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label` or `title` attributes and that it:
   - has a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"`;
   - and is devoid of textual alternatives;
   - and is devoid of alternative content present between the `<object>` and `</object>` tags.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
