title: Does each image (`<img>` tag) [decoration](#decoration-image), without [caption](#image-caption), satisfy one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The `<img>` tag has an empty `alt` attribute (`alt=""`) and is devoid of any other attribute allowing it to provide a [textual alternative](#textual-alternative-image).
  - The `<img>` tag has a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"` or `role="presentation"`.
---

1. Find decorative images without captions in the document, structured using a `<img>` element.
2. For each image, check that the image does not have `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label` or `title` attributes and that it has:
   - either an empty `alt` attribute (`alt=""`);
   - either a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-hidden="true"` or `role="presentation"`.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
