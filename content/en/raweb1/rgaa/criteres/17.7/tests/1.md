title: For each web application of [written communication in real time](#written-communication-in-real-time) the transmission delay of each [input unit](#input-unit) is 500ms or less . Is this rule respected?
---

1. Verify that the web application allows written communication in real time.
2. If so, activate the web application and the written communication functionality on two separate terminals and connect them to the same session.
3. Enter text on the first terminal and observe its appearance on the second terminal. The appearance on the second terminal must be instantaneous (less than half a second). Depending on the feature setting, each character is not sent individually. Indeed, if the real-time written communication functionality implements word prediction, it will be sent when the desired word is selected, and not when the first characters are entered to trigger the display of suggestion. A simple observation test may be sufficient to note the instantaneous appearance on the terminal which receives the written message.
4. If so, the test is validated.
