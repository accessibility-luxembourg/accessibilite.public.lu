title: For each `<th>` tag content that does not apply to the entire row or column, does the `<th>` tag check these conditions?
steps:
  - The `<th>` tag does not have a `scope` attribute.
  - The `<th>` tag does not have a WAI-ARIA `role="rowheader"` or `role="columnheader"` attribute.
  - The `<th>` tag has a unique `id` attribute.
---

1. Find the data tables in the document.
2. For each header (`<th>` element) that does not apply to the entire row or column, verify that the `<th>` element:
   - has a unique `id` attribute;
   - does not have a `scope` attribute;
   - does not have a WAI-ARIA `role="rowheader"` or `"columnheader"` attribute.
3. If this is the case for each header not applying to the entire row or column, **the test is validated**.
