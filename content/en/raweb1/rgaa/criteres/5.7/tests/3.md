title: For each content of the `<th>` tag that does not apply to the entire row or column, does the `<th>` tag meet these conditions?
steps:
  - The `<th>` tag does not have an `scope` attribute.
  - The `<th>` tag does not have a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="rowheader"` or `role="columnheader"`.
  - The `<th>` tag has a unique `id` attribute.
---

1. Find the data tables in the document.
2. For each header (element `<th>`) which does not apply to the whole row or column, check that the element `<th>`
   - has a unique `id` attribute;
   - does not have an `scope` attribute;
   - does not have a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="rowheader"` or `"columnheader"`.
3. If this is the case for each header that does not apply to the entire row or column, **the test is validated**.
