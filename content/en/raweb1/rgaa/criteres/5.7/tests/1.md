title: For each `<th>` tag content applying to the entire row or column, does the `<th>` tag respect one of these conditions (except in particular cases)?
steps:
  - The `<th>` tag has a unique `id` attribute.
  - The `<th>` tag has a `scope` attribute.
  - The `<th>` tag has a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="rowheader"` or `role="columnheader"`.
---

1. Find the data tables in the document.
2. For each header (`<th>` element) applying to the entire row or column, check that the `<th>` element has:
   - either a unique `id` attribute;
   - either a scope attribute;
   - either a WAI-ARIA `role="rowheader"` or `"columnheader"` attribute.
3. If this is the case for each header applying to the entire row or column, **the test is validated**.
