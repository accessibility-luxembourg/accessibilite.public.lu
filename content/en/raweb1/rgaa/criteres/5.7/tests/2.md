title: For each `<th>` tag content that applies to the entire row or column and has a `scope` attribute, does the `<th>` tag satisfy any of these conditions?
steps:
  - The `<th>` tag has a `scope` attribute with the value `"row"` for the [line headers](#column-or-line-header).
  - The `<th>` tag has a `scope` attribute with the value `"col"` for the [column headers](#column-or-row-header).
---

1. Find the data tables in the document.
2. For each header (`<th>` element) applying to the entire row or column and provided with a `scope` attribute, check that the `scope` attribute has:
   - either a `"row"` value for the line headers;
   - or a `"col"` value for the column headers.
3. If this is the case for each header applying to the entire row or column and provided with a `scope` attribute, **the test is validated**.
