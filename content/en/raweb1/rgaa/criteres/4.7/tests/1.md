title: For each [time-based media](#temporal-media-type-sound-video-and-synchronize) sound only, video only or synchronized, does the adjacent textual content clearly identify the [time-based media](#media-temporal-type-sound-video-and-synchronize) (excluding particular cases)?

1. Find in the document the pre-recorded time-based media only video, audio or synchronized.
2. For each time-based media, verify that a passage of text (a title or paragraph, for example) that immediately precedes or follows the time-based media allows it to be identified.
3. If this is the case for each time-based media, **the test is validated**.
