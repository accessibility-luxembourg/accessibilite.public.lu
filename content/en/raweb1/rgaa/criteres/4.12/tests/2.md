title: For each [non-temporal media](#non-temporal-media), does each feature satisfy one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The functionality is [activated by the keyboard and any pointing device](#accessible-and-activated-by-the-keyboard-and-any-pointing-device).
  - A functionality [activatable by the keyboard and any pointing device](#accessible-and-activable-by-the-keyboard-and-any-pointing-device) allowing the same action to be carried out is present on the page.

1. Find the non-temporal media provided with control functionalities in the document.
2. For each non-temporal media, check that:
   - either the functionality can be activated by the keyboard and any pointing device;
   - either a functionality that can be activated by the keyboard and any pointing device allowing the same action to be carried out is present on the page.
3. If this is the case for each non-temporal media, **the test is validated**.
