title: For each [real-time written communication](#real-time-written-communication) feature, do messages meet these conditions?
steps:
- Received and sent messages are separated in presentation;
- The presentation makes it possible to identify the nature of the message (received or sent);
- The nature of the message (received or sent) is accessible to assistive technologies.
---

1. Activate the web application and the application's real-time written communication functionality on two terminals and connect them to the same session.
2. Send a written message from both terminals to obtain messages with different statuses (sent and received).
3. Check:
- that sent and received messages are visually separated (for example, sent messages are in one window and received messages in another, or there is a line break between each received and sent message if they are presented in one same window);
- that it is visually possible to distinguish messages sent and messages received. For example, by a format or color that differentiates them or by a visible textual annotation (look for the words “Sent” near a message sent or “Received” near a message received);
- that information on the nature of the message (received or sent) is accessible to assistive technologies (textual information is available to provide this information).
4. If so, the test is validated.
