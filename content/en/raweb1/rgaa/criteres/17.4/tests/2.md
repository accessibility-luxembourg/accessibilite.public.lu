title: For each [real-time written communication](#real-time-written-communication) functionality used with a [two-way oral communication](#bidirectional-oral-communication-web-application) functionality that identifies the speakers, do the messages respect these conditions?
steps:
- The presentation makes it possible to identify the authors of the messages;
- The identification of the author of the message is accessible to assistive technologies.

1. Activate the web application and the application's real-time written communication functionality on two terminals and connect them to the same session.
2. Send a written message from both terminals to get messages with different authors.
3. Check that the authors of written messages are identified (for example, the presence of a name or identifier preceding the message).
4. If so, the test is validated.
