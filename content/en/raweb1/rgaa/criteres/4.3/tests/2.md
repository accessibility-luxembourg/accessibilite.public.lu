title: For each pre-recorded synchronized [temporal media](#temporal-media-type-sound-video-and-synchronize) having [synchronized subtitles](#subtitles-synchronizes-multimedia-object) broadcast via a `<track>` tag, does the `<track>` tag have a `kind="captions"` attribute?
---

1. Find synchronized time-based media with synchronized subtitles in the document using a `<track>` element.
2. For each synchronized time-based media, check that the `<track>` tag has a `kind="captions"` attribute.
3. If this is the case for each synchronized time media, **the test is validated**.
