title: Does each pre-recorded synchronized [time-based media](#temporal-media-type-sound-video-and-synchronize) verify, if necessary, one of these conditions (except in particular cases)?
steps:
  - The synchronized [time-based media](#temporal-media-type-sound-video-and-synchronize) has [synchronized subtitles](#synchronized-subtitles-multimedia-object).
  - There is an alternative version with [synchronized subtitles](#synchronized-multimedia-object-subtitles) accessible via an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button).
---

1. Find the synchronized pre-recorded time media in the document.
2. For each synchronized time-based media, check the presence of:
   - either synchronized subtitles;
   - or an alternative version with synchronized subtitles accessible by means of a link or an adjacent button.
3. If this is the case for each time-based media, **the test is validated**.
