title: Does each [editing tool](#edition-tool) provide [content creation aids](#accessible-content-creation-help) that comply with [ digital accessibility rules](#digital-accessibility-rules)?
---

1. Identify in the tool the presence of aids for creating accessible content. This may be :
- automatic or semi-automatic tests available from the editing functionalities;
- other automatic tools (a <i lang="en">chatbot</i> for example);
- documentation that explains how to set accessibility properties for each content element;
- manual tests available from the editing features to guide authors in detecting errors.
2. Check that the aids for creating accessible content are relevant, that is to say that the results or indications they give make it possible to create accessible content.
3. If so, the test is validated.
