title: For each pre-recorded [temporal media](#temporal-media-type-sound-video-and-synchronize), does the presentation of the subtitles meet one of these conditions?
steps:
- User-defined subtitle presentation system settings apply to subtitles.
- There is a feature in the page that allows the user to change the subtitle presentation settings.
---

1. Locate pre-recorded time-based media that have subtitles.
2. Define one or more subtitle presentation parameters from the customization options made available by the operating system, for example: subtitle size, color, subtitle border style, background color, background opacity, etc. (Note: the standard does not give the precise list of parameters that must be able to be defined, so the possibility of modifying a single characteristic of the subtitles is sufficient to make the criterion compliant).
3. Verify that the defined settings are applied to the subtitles.
4. Otherwise, locate on the page the presence of a functionality allowing you to modify the subtitle presentation parameters (on the page or directly from the media player).
5. Verify that the defined settings are applied to the subtitles.
6. If so, the test is validated.
