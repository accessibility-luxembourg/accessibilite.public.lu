title: For each `<select>` tag, are the [items of the same nature of a list of choices](#items-of-the-same-nature-of-a-liste-of-choice) grouped with a `<optgroup>` tag, if necessary?

1. Find the selection lists in the document (`<select>` element).
2. For each selection list offering groups of items of the same nature, check that these items are grouped using `<optgroup>` elements.
3. If this is the case for each selection list offering groups of items of the same nature, **the test is validated**.
