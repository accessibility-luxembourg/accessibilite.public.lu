title: For each `<select>` tag, are [items of the same type in a selection list](#items-of-the-same-type-in-a-selection-list) grouped together with an `<optgroup>` tag, if necessary?
---

1. Find the selection lists in the document (element `<select>`).
2. For each selection list offering groups of items of the same type, check that these items are grouped together using `<optgroup>` elements.
3. If this is the case for each selection list offering groups of similar items, **the test is validated**.
