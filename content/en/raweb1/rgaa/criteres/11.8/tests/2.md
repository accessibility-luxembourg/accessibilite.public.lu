title: In each `<select>` tag, does each `<optgroup>` tag have a `label` attribute?
---

1. Find in the document the selection lists (`<select>` element) which have `<optgroup>` elements.
2. For each `<optgroup>` element, check that it has a `label` attribute.
3. If this is the case for each `<optgroup>` element, **the test is validated**.
