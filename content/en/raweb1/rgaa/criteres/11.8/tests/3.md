title: For each `<optgroup>` tag having a `label` attribute, is the content of the `label` attribute relevant?
---

1. Find in the document the selection lists (`<select>` element) which have `<optgroup>` elements with a `label` attribute.
2. For each `label` attribute, check that its content is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each `label` attribute, **the test is validated**.
