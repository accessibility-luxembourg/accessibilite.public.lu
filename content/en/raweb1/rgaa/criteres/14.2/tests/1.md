title: For each [accessibility feature](#accessibility-feature) described in the [documentation](#documentation), the [mechanism that allows it to be activated](#mechanism-that-allows-to-activate -an-accessibility-feature) meets the accessibility needs of the users concerned. Is this rule respected (except in special cases)?
---

1. Identify the accessibility features described in the documentation. For example :
- access a simplified language version of the content;
- Increase the size of the text.
2. Verify that users affected by each accessibility feature are able to access it. For example :
- Alternative version in simplified language: the mechanism or set of mechanisms which enable the functionality must be understandable and identifiable by a person who benefits from the simplified language (for example, the use of <a href="https: //www.inclusion-europe.eu/easy-to-read/" hreflang="en">logo "Easy to read"</a> to identify the mechanism is a compliant solution).
- Enlargement of character size: if the mechanism contains text, then the text must be displayed by default with a font size equivalent to 200% of the font size.
3. Check that it is possible to activate this functionality.
4. If so, the test is validated.
