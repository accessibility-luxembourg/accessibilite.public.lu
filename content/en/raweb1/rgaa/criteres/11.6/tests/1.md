title: Does each grouping of [fields of the same nature](#fields-of-the-same-nature) have a [legend](#legend)?
---

1. Find groups of form fields of the same nature in the document.
2. For each group of form fields of the same nature, verify that:
   - If the grouping uses a `<fieldset>` element, the `<fieldset>` element has a `<legend>` element.
   - If the grouping element uses a WAI-ARIA `role="group"` or `"radiogroup"` attribute, it has a WAI-ARIA `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` attribute.
3. Otherwise, for each field of the same nature, check the presence:
   - either a title attribute making it possible to determine the field's membership in the field grouping;
   - either an `aria-label` attribute making it possible to determine the field's membership in the field grouping;
   - either an `aria-labelledby` attribute which references a passage of text allowing the field's membership in the field grouping to be determined;
   - either an `aria-describedby` attribute which references a passage of text making it possible to determine the field's membership in the field grouping;
4. If this is the case for each group of form fields or for each field of the same nature, **the test is validated**.
