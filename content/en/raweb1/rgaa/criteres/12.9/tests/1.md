title: In each web page, does each [element receiving focus](#taken-focus) satisfy one of these conditions?
steps:
  - It is possible to move to the next or previous focusable element with the tab key.
  - The user is informed of a functional mechanism allowing the keyboard to reach the next or previous element that can receive the focus.
---

1. Find in the document all the interface elements likely to receive the focus (using tabulation or using a script).
2. For each interface element, verify that the user can reach the next or previous element that can receive focus:
   - either using the tab key (<kbd>Tab</kbd> or <kbd>Shift+Tab</kbd>);
   - or by means of another keyboard interaction of which the user is informed (for example, the direction arrows).
3. If this is the case for each interface element, **the test is validated**.

Note: some complex interface elements, such as a group of radio buttons, a selection list and all components developed with WAI-ARIA use optimized navigations which generally use the direction arrows to move between parts of the component to the other. For example, in a group of radio buttons the options are navigable with the direction arrows. Likewise in a tab system the user activates the tabs with the direction arrows. The test on the keyboard trap is then limited to checking that the component is reached with the tab and that it is possible to move on to the next component or return to the previous component.
