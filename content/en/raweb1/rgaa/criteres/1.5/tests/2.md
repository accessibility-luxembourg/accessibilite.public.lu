title: Does each button associated with an image (`input` tag with the `type="image"` attribute) used as [CAPTCHA](#captcha) satisfy one of these conditions?
steps:
  - There is another form of non-graphical [CAPTCHA](#captcha), at least.
  - There is another solution for accessing the functionality secured by [CAPTCHA](#captcha).
---

1. Find in the document the buttons associated with an image (`<input>` elements with the `type="image"` attribute) used as CAPTCHA or as a test image.
2. For each button associated with an image, check that it exists:
   - or another form of non-graphical CAPTCHA, at least;
   - or another solution for accessing the functionality which is secured by CAPTCHA.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
