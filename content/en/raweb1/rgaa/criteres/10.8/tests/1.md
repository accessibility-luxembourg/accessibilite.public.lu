title: In each web page, does each hidden content satisfy one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The [hidden content](#cache-content) is intended to be ignored by assistive technologies.
  - The [hidden content](#cache-content) is not intended to be ignored by assistive technologies and is made retrievable by assistive technologies following a user action carried out on the keyboard or by any pointing device on an element preceding the hidden content or following a repositioning of the focus on it.
---

1. Find hidden content (elements with the `hidden` attribute or the WAI-ARIA `aria-hidden` attribute, or a class or set of CSS styles likely to hide the content) .
2. For each hidden content, check that:
   - Either the hidden content is intended to be ignored by assistive technologies (a statistical element of visits for example).
   - Either the hidden content is not intended to be ignored by assistive technologies, and in this case it is made reproducible by assistive technologies by means of:
     - Either from a user action carried out on the keyboard or by any pointing device on an element preceding the hidden content.
     - Either a programming function which repositions the focus on the content.
3. If this is the case for each hidden content, **the test is validated**.
