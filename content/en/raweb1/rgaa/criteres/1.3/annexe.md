#### Special cases

There is special case management when the image is used as [CAPTCHA](#captcha) or as a \[test image](#image-test). In this situation, where it is not possible to provide a relevant alternative without destroying the purpose of the CAPTCHA or the test, the criterion is not applicable.

Note: the case of CAPTCHAs and test images is dealt with specifically by criterion 1.4.
