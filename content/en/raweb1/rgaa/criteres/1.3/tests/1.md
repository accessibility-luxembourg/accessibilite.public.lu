steps:
  - If present, the content of the `alt` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the content of the `title` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the content of the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute is relevant.

1. Find in the document the images structured using a `<img>` element (or an element with the WAI-ARIA attribute `role="img"`) provided with a textual alternative.
2. For each image, check that the textual alternative is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
