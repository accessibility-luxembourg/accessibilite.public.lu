title: For each [image object](#image-object) (tag `<object>` with the attribute `type="image/..."`) [information carrier](#image-porteuse-d-information), with a [text alternative](#textual-image-alternative) or [alternative content](#alternative-content), is this alternative relevant (except in particular cases)?
steps:
  - If present, the content of the `title` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the content of the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the [text passage](#text-passage-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) associated via the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-labelledby` is relevant .
  - If present, [alternative content](#alternative-content) is relevant.

1. Find the `<object>` elements in the document with the `type="image/â€¦"` attribute and a textual alternative.
2. For each `<object>` element with the `type="image/..."` attribute, check that the textual alternative is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
