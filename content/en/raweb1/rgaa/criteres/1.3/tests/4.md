title: For each [object image](#object-image) (tag `<object>` with the attribute `type="image/..."`) [information-conveying](#image-conveying-information), having a [alternative text](#text-alternative-image) or an [alternative content](#alternative-content), is this alternative relevant (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - If present, the content of the `title` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the content of the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the [text passage](#passage-of-text-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) associated via the `aria-labelledby` WAI-ARIA attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the [alternative content](#alternative-content) is relevant.

1. Find elements in the document `<object>` with the attribute `type="image/..."` and a text alternative.
2. For each `<object>` element with the `type="image/..."` attribute, check that the text alternative is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
