title: For each bitmap image (`<canvas>` tag) [information carrier](#image-conveying-information) and having [alternative content](#alternative-content) between `<canvas>` and `</canvas>`, is this [alternative content](#alternative-content) [correctly rendered by assistive technologies](#correctly-rendered-by-assistive-technologies)?
---

1. Find the `<canvas>` elements in the document with alternative content between the `<canvas>` and `</canvas>` tags.
2. For each `<canvas>` element, verify that the alternative content is correctly rendered by the assistive technologies.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
