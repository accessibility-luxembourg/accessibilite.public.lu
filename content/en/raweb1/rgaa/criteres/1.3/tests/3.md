title: For each [button](#form-button) of type `image` (tag `<input>` with the attribute `type="image"`), with a \[textual alternative](#textual-alternative-image), is this alternative relevant (except in special cases)?
steps:
  - If present, the content of the `alt` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the content of the `title` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the content of the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the [text passage](#text-passage-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) associated via the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-labelledby` is relevant .

1. Find the `<input>` elements in the document with the `type="image"` attribute and a textual alternative.
2. For each `<input>` element with the `type="image"` attribute, check that the textual alternative is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
