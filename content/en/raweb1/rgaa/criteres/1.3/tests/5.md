title: For each embedded image (`<embed>` tag with the `type="image/..."` attribute) [information carrier](#information-carrying-image), having a [textual alternative] (#alternative-textual-image) or [alternative content](#alternative-content), is this alternative relevant (except in special cases)?
steps:
  - If present, the content of the `title` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the content of the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the [text passage](#text-passage-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) associated via the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-labelledby` is relevant .
  - If present, [alternative content](#alternative-content) is relevant.

1. Find the `<embed>` elements in the document with the `type="image/..."` attribute and a textual alternative.
2. For each `<embed>` element with the `type="image/â€¦"` attribute, check that the textual alternative is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
