1. Find in the document the functionalities that can be used or available by means of multi-point contact type touch interaction.
2. For each feature, verify that it remains available through contact-style touch interaction at a single point on the screen (for example, the ability to view items in a list with a swipe horizontal right or left must also be available by means of “previous” and “next” buttons or a pinch and zoom gesture which can alternatively be carried out by means of “plus” and “minus” buttons).
3. If this is the case for each feature usable or available through multi-touch touch interaction, **the test is validated**.
