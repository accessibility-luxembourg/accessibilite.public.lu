#### Particular cases

There is special case management in two types of situation:

- The criterion only applies to functionalities set up by the author of the site. It therefore does not concern gestures required by the user agent or the operating system;
- The criterion does not apply to functionalities where the performance of a complex gesture is essential (executing the drawing of a signature, for example).
