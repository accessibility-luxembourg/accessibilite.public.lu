title: In the compliant [mechanism for displaying a contrast ratio](#mechanism-for-displaying-a-compliant-contrast-ratio), the contrast ratio between the text and the color background level high enough?
---

1. Find in the document the mechanisms that allow you to display a consistent contrast ratio.
2. For each of these mechanisms, verify that the contrast ratio between the text and the background color is high enough.
3. If this is the case for each mechanism, **the test is validated**.
