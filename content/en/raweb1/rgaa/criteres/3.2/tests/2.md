title: In each web page, do the text and bold image text with a rendered size of less than 18.5px meet one of these conditions (except in particular cases)?
steps:
  - The [contrast](#contrast) ratio between the text and its background is 4.5:1, at least.
  - A mechanism allows the user to display text with a [contrast](#contrast) ratio of at least 4.5:1.

1. Find texts and bold image texts in the document with a rendered size of less than 18.5px which could cause contrast problems.
2. For each of these texts, check that:
   - either the contrast ratio between the text and its background is 4.5:1, at least;
   - either a mechanism allows the user to display the text with a contrast ratio of 4.5:1, at least.
3. If this is the case for each text, **the test is validated**.
