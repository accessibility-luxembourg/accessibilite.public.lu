title: In each web page, do the text and the text in images without fat effect with a rendered size greater than or equal to 24px meet one of these conditions (except in particular cases)?
steps:
  - The ratio of [contrast](#contrast) between the text and its background is 3:1, at least.
  - A mechanism allows the user to display text with a [contrast](#contrast) ratio of 3:1, at least.

1. Find in the document the texts and texts in images without fat effect with a rendered size greater than or equal to 24px which could pose contrast problems.
2. For each of these texts, check that:
   - either the contrast ratio between the text and its background is 3:1, at least;
   - either a mechanism allows the user to display the text with a contrast ratio of 3:1, at least.
3. If this is the case for each text, **the test is validated**.
