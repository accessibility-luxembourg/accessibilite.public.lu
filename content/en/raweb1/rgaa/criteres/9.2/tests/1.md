title: In each web page, does the [document structure](#document-structure) verify these conditions (except in particular cases)?
steps:
  - The [page header area](#header-area) is structured via a `<header>` tag.
  - The [main and secondary navigation areas](#menu-and-navigation-bar) are structured via a `<nav>` tag.
  - The `<nav>` tag is reserved for structuring the [main and secondary navigation areas](#menu-and-navigation-bar).
  - The [main content area](#main-content-area) is structured via a `<main>` tag.
  - The [document structure](#document-structure) uses a unique visible `<main>` tag.
  - The [footer area](#footer-area) is structured via a `<footer>` tag.

1. Check that the header area is structured using a `<header>` element.
2. Verify that the primary and secondary navigation areas are structured using a `<nav>` element.
3. Verify that the `<nav>` element is not used outside of the structuring of the main and secondary navigation areas.
4. Verify that the main content area is structured using a `<main>` element.
5. If the document has several `<main>` elements, check that only one of these elements is visible (other occurrences of the element have a `hidden` attribute).
6. Check that the footer area is structured using a `<footer>` element.
7. If this is the case for each content area, **the test is validated**.
