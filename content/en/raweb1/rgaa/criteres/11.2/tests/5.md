title: Does each [form field](#form-entry-field) having a [visible title](#visible-title) verify these conditions (except in special cases)?
steps:
  - If present, the content of the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute of the [form field](#form-input-field) contains at least the [visible label](#visible-title).
  - If present, the [text passage](#text-passage-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) linked to the [form field](#input-field-de-form) via a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-labelledby` contains at least the [visible title](#visible-title).
  - If present, the content of the `title` attribute of the [form field](#form-entry-field) contains at least the [visible title](#visible-title).
  - If present, the content of the `<label>` tag associated with the [form field](#form-entry-field) contains at least the [visible title](#visible-title).

1. Find in the document the form fields whose label is provided both by a visible title and by the content of either a `<label>` element, or a `title` attribute or a `aria-label` attribute or an `aria-labelledby` attribute.
2. For each form field, check that the content of the `<label>` element or the `title` attribute or the `aria-label` attribute or the `aria-labelledby` attribute contains the title visible.
3. If this is the case for each form field, **the test is validated**.
