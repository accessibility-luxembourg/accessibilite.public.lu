title: Does each button adjacent to the [form field](#form-input-field) that provides a visible label allow you to know the exact function of the [form field](#input-field-de-form) with which it is associated?
---

1. Find the form fields in the document whose visible label is provided by an adjacent button.
2. For each form field, verify that the visible content of the button is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each form field, **the test is validated**.
