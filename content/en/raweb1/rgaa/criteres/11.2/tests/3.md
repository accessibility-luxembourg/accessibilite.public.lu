title: Does each label implemented via the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute allow us to know the exact function of the [form field](#form-input-field) with which it is associated?
---

1. Find in the document the form fields whose label is provided by a WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute.
2. For each form field, verify that the content of the attribute is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each form field, **the test is validated**.
