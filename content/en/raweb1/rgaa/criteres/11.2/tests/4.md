title: Does each [text passage](#text-passage-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) associated via the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-labelledby` allow us to know the function exact [form field](#form-input-field) with which it is associated?
---

1. Find in the document the form fields whose label is provided by a WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute.
2. For each form field, verify that the content of the referenced text passage is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each form field, **the test is validated**.
