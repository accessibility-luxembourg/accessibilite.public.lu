title: Does each [script](#script) that generates or controls an [interface component](#interface-component) satisfy, if necessary, one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The [name, role, value, settings and state changes](#the-name-the-role-the-value-the-settings-and-state-changes) are accessible to assistive technologies via an accessibility API.
  - An accessible [interface component](#interface-component) allowing access to the same functionalities is present on the page.
  - An accessible [alternative](#alternative-a-script) provides access to the same functionalities.
---

1. Find in the document all the interface components generated or controlled using JavaScript.
2. Check that:
   - The component has a role consistent with its use (generally a button or a link).
   - The component has an explicit name.
   - The name of the component is consistent with the state of the functionality or controlled content (for example for a functionality allowing you to display or hide a content area).
3. Otherwise, check the presence of an accessible interface component allowing access to the same functionalities.
4. Otherwise, check the presence of an accessible alternative allowing access to the same functionalities.
5. If so, **the test is validated**.
