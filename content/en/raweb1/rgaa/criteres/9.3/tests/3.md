title: In each web page, does the information grouped in the form of [list](#lists) of description use the tags `<dl>` and `<dt>/<dd>`?

1. Find the elements grouped visually in the document in the form of a description list.
2. For each list, verify that the list is structured using the elements `<dl>`, `<dt>` and `<dd>`.
3. If this is the case for each description list, **the test is validated**.
