title: In each web page, does the information grouped visually in the form of ordered [list](#lists) satisfy one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The list uses the HTML tags `<ol>` and `<li>`.
  - The list uses the WAI-ARIA attributes `role="list"` and `role="listitem"`.
---

1. Find the elements grouped visually in the document in the form of an ordered list.
2. For each list, check that the list is structured:
   - either by means of the elements `<ol>` and `<li>`;
   - either by means of elements with WAI-ARIA attributes `role="list"` and `role="listitem"`.
3. If this is the case for each ordered list, **the test is validated**.
