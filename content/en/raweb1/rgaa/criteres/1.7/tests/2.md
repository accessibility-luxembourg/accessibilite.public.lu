steps:
  - The [detailed description](#detailed-description-image) on the page and indicated by the [text alternative](#text-alternative-image) is relevant.

1. Find elements in the document `<input>` with the attribute `type="image"` which have a detailed description.
2. For each `<input>` element with the `type="image"` attribute, check that the detailed description is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
