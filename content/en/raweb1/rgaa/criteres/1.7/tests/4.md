title: Each embedded image (tag `<embed>` with the attribute `type="image/…"`) [information carrier](#image-carrier-d-information), having a [detailed description]( #detail-image-description), does it verify these conditions?
steps:
  - The [detailed description](#description-detaillee-image) in the page and indicated by the [textual alternative](#alternative-textual-image) is relevant.
  - The [detailed description](#description-detaillee-image) adjacent to the embedded image is relevant.
  - The [detailed description](#detailed-image-description) via an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) is relevant.
  - The associated text passage via the WAI-ARIA `aria-describedby` attribute is relevant.

1. Find the `<embed>` elements in the document with the `type="image/…"` attribute which have a detailed description.
2. For each `<embed>` element with the `type="image/…"` attribute, check that the detailed description is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
