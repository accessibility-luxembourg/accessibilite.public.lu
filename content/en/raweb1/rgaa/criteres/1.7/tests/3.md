title: Each [image object](#image-object) (tag `<object>` with the attribute `type="image/…"`) [information carrier](#image-porteuse-d-information) , having a [detailed description](#detailed-image-description), does it satisfy these conditions?
steps:
  - The [detailed description](#description-detaillee-image) in the page and indicated by the [text alternative](#alternative-textual-image) is relevant.
  - The [detailed description](#detail-image-description) adjacent to the [object image](#object-image) is relevant.
  - The [detailed description](#detailed-image-description) via an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) is relevant.
  - The associated text passage via the WAI-ARIA `aria-describedby` attribute is relevant.

1. Find in the document the `<object>` elements with the `type="image/…"` attribute which have a detailed description.
2. For each `<object>` element with the `type="image/…"` attribute, check that the detailed description is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
