title: In each web page, is there a link to avoid the [main content area](#main-content-area) or to access it (except in particular cases)?
---

1. Find the main content area in the document (indicated by the visible main element).
2. Check that the area:
   - either can be avoided by means of an avoidance link directly preceding the zone in the order of the source code;
   - or can be reached by means of a quick access link visible when taking focus when tabulating.
3. If so, **the test is validated**.
