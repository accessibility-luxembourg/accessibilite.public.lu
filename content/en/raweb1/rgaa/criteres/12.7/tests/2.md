title: In each set of pages, the [skip-or-quick-access link](#skip-or-quick-access-links) to the [main content area](#quick-access-area) main-content) does it verify these conditions (except in particular cases)?
steps:
  - The link is located in the same place in the presentation.
  - The link always appears in the same relative order in the source code.
  - The link is visible or, failing that, visible when focusing.
  - The link is functional.

1. Find the main content area in the document (indicated by the visible main element).
2. Check that the avoidance or rapid access link to the area is:
   - located in the same place in the presentation;
   - always present in the same relative order in the source code (generated on the client side);
   - visible when focusing when tabbing;
   - functional.
3. If so, **the test is validated**.
