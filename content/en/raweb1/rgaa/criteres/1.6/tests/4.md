title: Each [button](#form-button) of type image (tag `<input>` with the attribute `type="image"`) [information carrier](#information-bearer-image) , which requires a [detailed description](#detail-image-description), does it satisfy one of these conditions?
steps:
  - There is a [textual alternative](#textual-image-alternative) containing the reference to a [detailed description](#detailed-image-description) adjacent to the image.
  - There is an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) allowing access to the [detailed description](#detail-image-description).
  - There is a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-describedby` associating a [text passage](#text-passage-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) acting as [detailed description]( #detailed-image-description).

1. Find in the document the `<input>` elements with the `type="image"` attribute, carrying information which requires a detailed description.
2. For each `<input>` element with the `type="image"` attribute, check that it exists:
   - either a textual alternative containing the reference to a detailed description adjacent to the image;
   - either a link or an adjacent button allowing access to the detailed description;
   - either a WAI-ARIA aria-describedby attribute associating a passage of text serving as a detailed description.
3. If this is the case for each `<input>` element with the `type="image"` attribute, **the test is validated**.
