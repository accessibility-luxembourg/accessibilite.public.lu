title: Each bitmap image (`<canvas>` tag), [information carrier](#image-conveying-information), which requires a [detailed description](#detailed-image-description), checks t one of these conditions?
steps:
  - There is a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-label` containing the text alternative and a reference to an adjacent [detailed description](#description-detailee-image).
  - There is a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-labelledby` combining a passage of text acting as a textual alternative and another serving as [detailed description](#description-detaillee-image).
  - There is textual content between `<canvas>` and `</canvas>` referring to a [detailed description](#description-detailee-image) adjacent to the bitmap image.
  - There is textual content between `<canvas>` and `</canvas>` acting as [detailed description](#description-detailee-image).
  - There is an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) allowing access to the [detailed description](#detail-image-description).

1. Find in the document the `<canvas>` elements carrying information which require a detailed description.
2. For each `<canvas>` element, check that it exists:
   - either a WAI-ARIA aria-label attribute containing the textual alternative and a reference to an adjacent detailed description;
   - either a WAI-ARIA aria-labelledby attribute associating a passage of text serving as a textual alternative and another serving as a detailed description;
   - either textual content between `<canvas>` and `</canvas>` referring to a detailed description adjacent to the bitmap image;
   - either textual content between `<canvas>` and `</canvas>` serving as a detailed description;
   - either a link or an adjacent button allowing access to the detailed description.
3. If this is the case for each `<canvas>` element, **the test is validated**.
