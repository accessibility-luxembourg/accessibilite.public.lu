title: Each embedded image (tag `<embed>`) [information carrier](#image-carrier-d-information), which requires a [detailed description](#description-detaillee-image), checks she one of these conditions?
steps:
  - There is a [textual alternative](#textual-image-alternative) containing the reference to a [detailed description](#detailed-image-description) adjacent to the image.
  - There is an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) allowing access to the [detailed description](#detail-image-description).
---

1. Find in the document the `<embed>` elements with the `type="image/…"` attribute, carrying information which requires a detailed description.
2. For each `<embed>` element with the `type="image/…"` attribute, check that it exists:
   - either a textual alternative containing the reference to a detailed description adjacent to the image;
   - either a link or an adjacent button allowing access to the detailed description.
3. If this is the case for each `<embed>` element with the `type="image/…"` attribute, **the test is validated**.
