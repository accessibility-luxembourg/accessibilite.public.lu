title: Each tag having a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="img"` [information carrier](#image-carrier-d-information), which requires a [detailed description](#description-detaillee-image), does it satisfy any of these conditions?
steps:
  - There is a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-label` containing the [textual alternative](#textual-alternative-image) and a reference to an adjacent [detailed description](#detailed-image-description).
  - There is a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-labelledby` associating a [text passage](#text-passage-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) acting as a [textual alternative] (#alternative-textual-image) and another serving as [detailed description](#description-detailee-image).
  - There is a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-describedby` associating a [text passage](#text-passage-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) acting as [detailed description]( #detailed-image-description).
  - There is an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) allowing access to the [detailed description](#detail-image-description).

1. Find in the document the elements with a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="img"` carrying information which require a detailed description.
2. For each `role="img"` element, check that it exists:
   - either a WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute containing the textual alternative and a reference to an adjacent detailed description;
   - either a WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute associating a passage of text serving as a textual alternative and another serving as a detailed description;
   - either a WAI-ARIA `aria-describedby` attribute associating a passage of text serving as a detailed description;
   - either a link or an adjacent button allowing access to the detailed description.
3. If this is the case for each `role="img"` element, **the test is validated**.
