1. Find in the document the `<svg>` elements carrying information whose detailed description is provided using an `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby` attribute.
2. For each `<svg>` element, check that the content of the detailed description is correctly rendered by the assistive technologies.
3. If this is the case for each `<svg>` element, **the test is validated**.
