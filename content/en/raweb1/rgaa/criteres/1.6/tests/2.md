title: Each [image object](#image-object) (tag `<object>` with the attribute `type="image/…"`) [information carrier](#image-porteuse-d-information) , which requires a [detailed description](#detailed-image-description), does it satisfy one of these conditions?
steps:
  - There is a [textual alternative](#textual-image-alternative) containing the reference to a [detailed description](#detailed-image-description) adjacent to the image.
  - There is an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) allowing access to the [detailed description](#detail-image-description).
---

1. Find in the document the `<object>` elements with the `type="image/…"` attribute, carrying information which requires a detailed description.
2. For each `<object>` element with the `type="image/…"` attribute, check that it exists:
   - either a textual alternative containing the reference to a detailed description adjacent to the image;
   - either a link or an adjacent button allowing access to the detailed description.
3. If this is the case for each `<object>` element with the `type="image/…"` attribute, **the test is validated**.
