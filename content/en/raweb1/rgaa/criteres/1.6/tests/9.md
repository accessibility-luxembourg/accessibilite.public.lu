title: For each image (tag `<img>`, `<input>` with attribute `type="image"`, `<area>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, `< svg>`, `<canvas>`, or having a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="img"`) [information carrier](#information-bearer-image), which is accompanied by a [description detailed](#description-detailee-image) and which uses a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-describedby`, does the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-describedby` associate the [detailed description](#description-detailee-picture) ?
---

1. Find the images in the document (elements `<img>`, `<input>` with the attribute `type="image"`, `<area>`, `<object>`, `<embed>` , `<svg>`, `<canvas>` or having a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="img"`) carrying information whose detailed description uses a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-describedby`.
2. For each image, check that the content of the detailed description is correctly rendered by the assistive technologies.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
