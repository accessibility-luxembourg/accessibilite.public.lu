title: For each image (tag `<img>`, `<input>` with the attribute `type="image"`, `<area>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<svg>`, `<canvas>`, or having a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="img"`) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information), which is accompanied by a [detailed description](#detailed-description-image) and which uses a WAI-ARIA `aria-describedby` attribute, does the WAI-ARIA `aria-describedby` attribute associate the [detailed description](#detailed-description-image)?
---

1. Find in the document the images (elements `<img>`, `<input>` with the attribute `type="image"`, `<area>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<svg>`, `<canvas>` or possessing a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="img"`) conveying information whose detailed description uses a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-describedby`.
2. For each image, check that the content of the detailed description is correctly rendered (by assistive technologies).
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
