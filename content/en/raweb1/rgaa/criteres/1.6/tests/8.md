title: For each bitmap image (`<canvas>` tag) [information carrier](#information-carrying-image), which implements a reference to an adjacent [detailed-description](#detailed-image-description) , is this reference correctly rendered by assistive technologies?
---

1. Find in the document the `<canvas>` elements carrying information whose detailed description is provided using an `aria-label`, `aria-labelledby` or `aria-describedby` attribute.
2. For each `<canvas>` element, check that the content of the detailed description is correctly rendered by the assistive technologies.
3. If this is the case for each `<canvas>` element, **the test is validated**.
