title: Does each image (`<img>` tag) [information carrier](#image-conveying-information), which requires a [detailed description](#detailed-image-description), verify one of these conditions?
steps:
  - There is a [text alternative](#textual-image-alternative) containing the reference to a [detailed description](#detailed-image-description) adjacent to the image.
  - There is an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) allowing access to the [detailed description](#detail-image-description).
---

1. Find in the document the images structured using an `<img>` element (or an element with the WAI-ARIA attribute `role="img"`) carrying information which require a detailed description .
2. For each image, check that it exists:
   - Either a textual alternative containing the reference to a detailed description adjacent to the image;
   - Either a link or an adjacent button allowing access to the detailed description.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
