#### Special cases

There is special case management when:

- The [non-temporal media](#non-temporal-media) is used for decorative purposes (i.e. it does not provide any information);
- The [non-temporal media](#non-temporal-media) is broadcast in a [controlled environment](#control-environment);
- The [non-temporal media](#non-temporal-media) is inserted via JavaScript by checking the presence and version of the plug-in, replacing an [alternative content](#alternative-content) already present.

In these situations, the criterion is not applicable.
