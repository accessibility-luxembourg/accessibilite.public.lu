1. Find the non-temporal media associated with an alternative in the document.
2. For each non-temporal media, check that:
   - the page referenced by the adjacent link or button is accessible;
   - the alternative on the page, referenced by the adjacent link or button, is accessible.
3. If this is the case for each non-temporal media, **the test is validated**.
