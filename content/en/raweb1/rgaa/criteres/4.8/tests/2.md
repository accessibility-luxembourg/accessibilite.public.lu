title: Does each [non-time-based media](#non-temporal-media) associated with an alternative satisfy one of these conditions (except in particular cases)?
steps:
  - The page referenced by the [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) is accessible.
  - The alternative in the page, referenced by the [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button), is accessible.

1. Find the non-time-based media associated with an alternative in the document.
2. For each non-time-based media, check that:
   - the page referenced by the adjacent link or button is accessible;
   - the alternative on the page, referenced by the adjacent link or button, is accessible.
3. If this is the case for each non-time-based media, **the test is validated**.
