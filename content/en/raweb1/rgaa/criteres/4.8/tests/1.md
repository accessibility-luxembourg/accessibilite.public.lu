title: Does each [non-temporal media](#non-temporal-media) verify, if necessary, one of these conditions (except in special cases)?
steps:
  - A clearly identifiable [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) provides access to a page containing an alternative.
  - A clearly identifiable [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) provides access to an alternative on the page.
---

1. Find non-temporal media in the document.
2. For each non-temporal media, check that an adjacent, clearly identifiable link or button:
   - either contains the address (url) of a page containing an alternative;
   - either allows access to an alternative on the page.
3. If this is the case for each non-temporal media, **the test is validated**.
