title: For each [two-way oral communication](#two-way-oral-communication-web-application) web application that has real-time video, are the following conditions met?
steps:
  - The video resolution meets the [QVGA](#qvga) standard at least;
  - The frame rate is at least 20 frames per second;
  - The delay between video and lyrics should not be more than 100ms.
---

For conditions regarding resolution and frame rate, the safest way to evaluate this criterion is to search either the interface or the application documentation to obtain this information. It is also recommended to ask the application publisher to provide these technical details.

For the last condition concerning the delay between the video and the audio, the test can be established on a simple observation:
1. Activate the web application on two devices.
2. Establish a video call connection between the two terminals.
3. Check the synchronization between the lyrics and the video (lip sync, lip movement).
4. If so, the test is validated.
