title: For each [time-based media](#temporal-media-type-sound-video-and-synchronize) having a synchronized [audio description](#audiodescription-synchronized-temporal-media), is this relevant?

1. Find the synchronized time media in the document that have audio description.
2. For each time-based media, check that the synchronized audio description is relevant (all the visual information that can be vocalized in the blanks of the main soundtrack is present, in particular the embedded texts).
3. If this is the case for each synchronized time media, **the test is validated**.
