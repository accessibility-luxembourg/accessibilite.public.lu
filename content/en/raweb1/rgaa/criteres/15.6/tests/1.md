title: Is each [template](#template) that meets the [digital accessibility rules](#digital-accessibility-rules) clearly identifiable?
---

1. Identify the presence of templates that fully comply with digital accessibility rules made available by the editing tool.
2. Check the presence of an explicit mention allowing them to be identified. For example, from the list of templates, compliant templates have an “accessible template” label.
3. If so, the test is validated.
