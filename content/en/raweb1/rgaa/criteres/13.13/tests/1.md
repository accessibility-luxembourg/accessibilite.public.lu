2. Locate the accessibility information present in the original content (alternative of a graphic element, heading levels, table of contents, etc.).
3. Check in the document resulting from the conversion that the accessibility information is still present (unless the chosen conversion format does not have support for the accessibility information of the source document).
4. If so, the test is validated.
