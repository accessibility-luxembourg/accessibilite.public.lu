title: In each web page tags (except `<div>`, `<span>` and `<table>`) must not be used [for presentation purposes only](#only-a -for-presentation-purposes). Is this rule respected?

1. Find in the document all the semantic elements used for presentation purposes
2. For each of these elements, check that:
   - The element has a `role="presentation"` attribute.
   - The use of this element for presentation purposes remains justified.
3. If so, **the test is validated**.

Note: Some non-exhaustive examples of markup misuse: a `<div>` element used as a paragraph, a title used as a caption, a `<blockquote>` element or empty paragraphs or even spaces used to create text effects. margins.
The use of a `role="presentation"` is strictly discouraged, but can nevertheless be justified in rare cases. This may be acceptable on a `<blockquote>` element or an empty paragraph, but will be considered non-compliant on a title.

The case of tables: note that this test addresses presentation tables which should ultimately not appear within the Tables theme.
