title: Does each [object image](#object-image) with a [legend](#image-caption) (tag `<object>` with the attribute `type="image/..."` associated with an adjacent [legend](#image-caption), if necessary, meet these conditions?
steps:
  - The [object image](#image-object) and its adjacent [legend](#image-caption) are contained in a `<figure>` tag.
  - The `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="figure"` or `role="group"`.
  - The `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute whose content is identical to the content of the [legend](#image-caption).
  - The [legend](#image-caption) is contained in a `<figcaption>` tag.

1. Find object images with a legend in the document (element `<object>` with the attribute `type="image/..."`).
2. For each image, check that
   - the image and its legend are contained in a `<figure>` tag;
   - the `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA property `role="figure`" or `role="group"`;
   - the `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute whose content is identical to the content of the legend;
   - the legend is contained in a `<figcaption>` tag.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
