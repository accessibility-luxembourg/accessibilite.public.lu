title: Each [image object](#image-object) provided with a [caption](#caption-of-image) (tag `<object>` with the attribute `type="image/â€¦"` associated with does an adjacent [caption](#image-caption), verify, if necessary, these conditions?
steps:
  - The [object image](#object-image) and its adjacent [caption](#image-caption) are contained in a `<figure>` tag.
  - The `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="figure"` or `role="group"`.
  - The `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute whose content is identical to the content of the [caption](#image-caption).
  - The [caption](#image-caption) is contained in a `<figcaption>` tag.

1. Find in the document the object images provided with a caption (element `<object>` with the attribute `type="image/..."`).
2. For each image, check that:
   - the image and its caption are contained in a `<figure>` tag;
   - the `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA property `role="figure`" or `role="group"`;
   - the tag `<figure>` has a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-label` whose content is identical to the content of the legend;
   - the caption is contained in a `<figcaption>` tag.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
