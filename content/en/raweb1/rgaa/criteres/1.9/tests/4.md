title: Does each vector image with a [legend](#image-caption) (`<svg>` tag associated with an adjacent [legend](#image-caption)), if necessary, meet these conditions?
steps:
  - The vector image (`<svg>` tag) and its adjacent [legend](#image-caption) are contained in a `<figure>` tag.
  - The `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA `role="figure"` or `role="group"` attribute.
  - The `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute whose content is identical to the content of the [legend](#image-caption).
  - The [legend](#image-caption) is contained in a `<figcaption>` tag.

1. Find in the document the vector images with a legend (`<svg>` element).
2. For each image, check that
   - the image and its legend are contained in a `<figure>` tag;
   - the `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA `role="figure"` or `role="group"` property;
   - the `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute whose content is identical to the content of the legend;
   - the legend is contained in a `<figcaption>` tag.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
