title: If necessary, does each image with a [legend](#image-caption) (tag `<img>`, `<input>` with the attribute `type="image"` or with a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="img"` associated with an adjacent [legend](#image-caption)) meet these conditions?
steps:
  - The image (tag `<img>`, `<input>` with the attribute `type="image"` or having a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="img"`) and its adjacent [legend](#image-caption) are contained in a tag `<figure>`.
  - The `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="figure"` or `role="group"`.
  - The `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute whose content is identical to the content of the [legend](#image-caption).
  - The [legend](#image-caption) is contained in a `<figcaption>` tag.

1. In the document, find images with a legend structured using the `<img>` element, a `<input>` element with the `type="image"` attribute or an element with the WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute.
2. For each image, check that
   - the image and its legend are contained in a `<figure>` tag;
   - the `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA property `role="figure"` or `role="group"`;
   - the `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute whose content is identical to the content of the legend;
   - the legend is contained in a `<figcaption>` tag.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
