title: Each embedded image provided with a [caption](#legend-d-image) (tag `<embed>` associated with an adjacent [caption](#legend-d-image), does it verify, if necessary, these conditions?
steps:
  - The embedded image (`<embed>` tag) and its adjacent [caption](#legend-d-image) are contained in a `<figure>` tag.
  - The `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="figure"` or `role="group"`.
  - The `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute whose content is identical to the content of the [caption](#image-caption).
  - The [caption](#image-caption) is contained in a `<figcaption>` tag.

1. Find the embedded images provided with a caption in the document (`<embed>` element with the `type="image/â€¦"` attribute).
2. For each image, check that:
   - the image and its caption are contained in a `<figure>` tag;
   - the `<figure>` tag has a WAI-ARIA property `role="figure"` or `role="group"`;
   - the tag `<figure>` has a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-label` whose content is identical to the content of the legend;
   - the caption is contained in a `<figcaption>` tag.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
