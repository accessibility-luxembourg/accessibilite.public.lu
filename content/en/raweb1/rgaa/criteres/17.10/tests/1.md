title: For each web application of [two-way oral communication](#web-application-of-two-way-oral-communication) which has [voice functionalities](#voice-functionalities), can these be used without the need to listen or speak?
---

1. Identify in the web application the functionalities available (apart from the oral communication functionality) which are based on listening to information or speaking commands, for example:
- voicemail;
- an automatic telephone switchboard (for example, which requires you to say a number between 1 and 4 to be redirected to a service);
- or any other interactive voice server.
2. Check:
- that the information is available without having to listen or speak (for example through a text transcription or a chat system);
- that the actions can be performed without having to listen or speak or that there is an alternative to the functionality that can be used without having to listen or speak.
3. If so, the test is validated.
