title: For each [temporal media](#media-temporal-type-son-video-et-synchronise) which has a track of [synchronized subtitles](#subtitles-synchronises-object-multimedia) or of an [audiodescription](#temporal-media-synchronized-audiodescription), do the control functionalities of these alternatives respect these conditions?
steps:
  - For each temporal media, the functionality which allows you to activate and deactivate the subtitles is presented at the same level as the [main functionalities](#main-functionalities-of-a-temporal-media).
  - For each temporal media, the functionality which allows you to activate and deactivate audio description is presented at the same level as the [main functionalities](#main-functionalities-of-a-temporal-media).

1. Locate pre-recorded time-based media with a synchronized caption track or audio description.
2. Check that it is possible to activate and deactivate subtitles or audio description without additional steps compared to the main functionalities (playing, pausing, etc.).
3. If so, the test is validated.

<i>Example:</i> If the play button can be activated from the interface by a simple mouse click (without the need to activate a first component to display a drop-down menu for example), the sub-function titles must be available in an equivalent manner, with a single click. Conversely, if the subtitles function is available from a drop-down menu which must be activated beforehand (by clicking a mouse for example), it will not be considered to be at the same level since there will be a step additional to achieve.
