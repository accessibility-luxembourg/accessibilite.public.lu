title: For each web application of [bidirectional oral communication](#bidirectional-oral-communication-web-application) which makes it possible to identify the activity of an oral interlocutor, it is possible to identify the activity of 'a signing interlocutor. Is this rule respected?
---

1. Activate the web application and start a video call between the two terminals.
2. Initiate an oral activity, and check the presence on the second terminal of information allowing this activity to be identified (for example, the presence of a colored halo around the thumbnail of the active interlocutor).
3. If so:
- identify the presence of a manual mechanism (for example, a button) which would allow the signing party to indicate that they are signing;
- otherwise, perform gestures in front of the camera (see note) and check the automatic display of information allowing this visual activity to be identified.
4. If so, the test is validated.


**Note:** in communication applications, the identification of an oral activity is not based on the identification of an intelligible verbal message (word or sentence for example) but only on the identification of a sound (a noise for example). Thus, a visual activity, even if it does not correspond to an element understandable in sign language, could be automatically detected by this application and would therefore serve as a mechanism to identify the activity of a signing person. It is therefore possible to test by making gestures even if they do not correspond to an element of meaning in sign language.
