title: Does each [status message](#status-message) which informs of the success, the result of an action or the state of an application use the WAI-ARIA attribute ` role="status"`?
---

1. Find the messages in the document that are considered status messages.
2. For each of these messages, determine the nature of the information contained in the message:
3. If the message informs of success, the result of an action or the state of an application, check that the element which contains the message:
   - either uses the WAI-ARIA attribute `role="status"`;
   - either uses the WAI-ARIA attributes `aria-live="polite"` and `aria-atomic="true"`.
4. If the message presents a suggestion, or warns of the existence of an error, verify that the element containing the message:
   - either use the WAI-ARIA `role="alert"` attribute;
   - either use the `aria-live="assertive"` and `aria-atomic="true"` attributes.
5. If the message indicates the progress of a process, verify that the element containing the message:
   - either uses one of the WAI-ARIA attributes `role="log"`, `role="progressbar"` or `role="status"`;
   - either use the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-live="polite"` if the intention is to signal the equivalent of a `log' role`;
   - either use the WAI-ARIA attributes `aria-live="polite"` and `aria-atomic="true"` if the intention is to signal the equivalent of a `"status"` role.
6. If so, **the test is validated**.
