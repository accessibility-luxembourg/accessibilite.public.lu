title: In each web page, does each change of [reading direction](#reading-direction) (`dir` attribute) satisfy these conditions?
steps:
  - The value of the `dir` attribute is compliant (`rtl` or `ltr`)
  - The value of the `dir` attribute is relevant.
---

1. For each passage of text validated in test 8.10.1, check that:
   - The reading direction indication is consistent (ltr, for the “left to right” direction and rtl for the “right to left” direction)
   - The indication of reading direction is relevant.
2. If this is the case for each passage of text, **the test is validated**.
