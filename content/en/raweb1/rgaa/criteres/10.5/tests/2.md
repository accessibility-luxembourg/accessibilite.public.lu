title: In each web page, is each declaration of background color (`background`, `background-color`), of an element likely to contain text, accompanied by a declaration of font color (`color `) at least, inherited from a parent?

1. Find the colored texts in the document, with the exception of the default colors (for example links, etc.).
2. Determine the element that contains the text and check for the presence of a calculated value for the `color` property of the element.
3. If so, **the test is validated**.
