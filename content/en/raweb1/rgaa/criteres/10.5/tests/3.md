title: In each web page, is each use of an image to create a background color for an element likely to contain text, via CSS (`background`, `background-image`), accompanied by a background-color declaration (`background`, `background-color`), at least, inherited from a parent?

1. Find the texts in the document whose background consists of an image (`background-color` property).
2. Determine the element that contains the text and verify that if the background image is absent, the text remains readable.
3. If so, **the test is validated**.
