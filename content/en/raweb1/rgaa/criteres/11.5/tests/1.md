title: Do [fields of the same kind](#fields-of-same-kind) meet any of these conditions, if necessary?
steps:
  - The [fields of same kind](#fields-of-same-kind) are grouped together in a `<fieldset>` tag.
  - The [fields of the same kind](#fields-of-same-kind) are grouped together in a tag with a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="group"`.
  - The [fields of the same kind](#fields-of-same-kind) of radio type (`<input type="radio">`) or tags with a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="radio"`) are grouped together in a tag with a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="radiogroup"` or `role="group"`.

1. Find the fields of the same kind in the document (for example, a group of identity information entries, a series of tick boxes, a date entry in several successive fields, etc.).
2. For each group of form fields of the same kind, check that these fields of the same kind are grouped together:
   - either in a `<fieldset>` element;
   - or in an element with a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="group"`;
   - or in an element with a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="radiogroup"` or `"group"`, in the case of `<input>` elements of type `radio` (or elements with a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="radio"`).
3. If this is the case for each group of form fields of the same kind, **the test is validated**.
