title: Do [like fields](#like-fields) satisfy any of these conditions, if necessary?
steps:
  - The [fields of the same nature](#fields-of-the-same-nature) are grouped in a `<fieldset>` tag.
  - The [fields of the same nature](#fields-of-the-same-nature) are grouped in a tag with a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="group"`.
  - The [fields of the same nature](#fields-of-the-same-nature) of radio type (`<input type="radio">`) or tags with a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="radio"`) are grouped in a tag with a WAI-ARIA `role="radiogroup"` or `role="group"` attribute.

1. Find form fields of the same nature in the document (for example a group for entering identity information, a series of check boxes, date entry on several successive fields, etc.).
2. For each group of form fields of the same nature, check that these fields of the same nature are grouped:
   - either in a `<fieldset>` element;
   - either in an element with a WAI-ARIA `role="group"` attribute;
   - either in an element having a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="radiogroup"` or `"group"`, if they are `<input>` elements of type `radio` (or elements having a WAI-ARIA `role="radio"` attribute).
3. If this is the case for each group of form fields of the same nature, **the test is validated**.
