title: In each web page where they are present, the [header] area (#header-area), [main navigation] (#menu-and-navigation-bar), [main content](#main-content-area), [footer](#footer-area) and [search engine](#internal-search-engine- does a-a-website) meet at least one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The zone has a WAI-ARIA role of type [landmark](#landmarks) corresponding to its nature.
  - The zone has a title whose content allows you to understand the nature of the content of the zone.
  - The zone can be hidden using a button directly preceding the zone in the order of the source code.
  - The zone can be avoided by means of an [avoidance link](#avoid-or-quick-access-links) directly preceding the zone in the order of the source code.
  - The area can be reached via a [quick access link](#avoid-or-quick-access-links) visible or, failing that, visible when focusing.

1. Find the content grouping areas in the document (header, main navigation, main content, footer and search engine areas).
2. For each zone, verify that the zone:
   - either has a WAI-ARIA role of landmark type corresponding to its nature;
   - either has a hierarchy title whose content makes it possible to understand the nature of the content of the zone;
   - either can be hidden using a button directly preceding the area in the order of the source code;
   - either can be avoided by means of an avoidance link directly preceding the zone in the order of the source code;
   - either can be reached by means of a quick access link, visible by default, or visible when the focus is taken during a tabulation.
3. If this is the case for each content grouping zone, **the test is validated**.
