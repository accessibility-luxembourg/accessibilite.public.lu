title: In each web page, is the [tab order](#tab-order) in the content [consistent](#comprehensible-reading-order)?
---

1. Browse all contents in the document using the tab key forward (Tab key) and backward (Shift+Tab key).
2. Check that the order of movement of the focus remains consistent with the content considered (for example, the tab order in a modal window must only consider the interface elements present within this window).
3. If so, **the test is validated**.

Note: Tabulation is not required to follow the natural reading order (left to right and top to bottom for example) as long as the elements are accessible in a consistent order.
