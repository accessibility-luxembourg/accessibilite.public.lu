title: For each [script](#script) that updates or inserts content, does the [tab order](#tab-order) remain [consistent](#comprehensible-order-of -reading) ?

1. Find all the content inserted in the document using a script (display of hidden elements, update of content via AJAX for example).
2. Position the tab on the trigger and activate it.
3. After displaying the updated content, check that the tabulation remains consistent (correct focus repositioning).
4. If so, **the test is validated**.
