#### Particular cases

There are interfaces for which the orientation of the device is essential to their use.

In these situations, the criterion is not applicable. These could be gaming interfaces, piano, bank check deposit, etc.

If the interface is the only way to access the service offered, an alternative should be put in place to compensate for this deficiency.
