title: For each [data table](#data-table), each [row header](#column-or-row-header) applying to the entire line satisfy any of these conditions?
steps:
  - The [row header](#column-or-line-header) is structured using a `<th>` tag.
  - The [line header](#column-or-line-header) is structured using a tag with a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="rowheader"`.
---

1. Find the data tables in the document.
2. For each line header that applies to the entire line, verify that the line header is structured using:
   - either an element `<th>`;
   - or an element with a WAI-ARIA `role="rowheader"` attribute.
3. If this is the case for each line header applying to the entire line, **the test is validated**.
