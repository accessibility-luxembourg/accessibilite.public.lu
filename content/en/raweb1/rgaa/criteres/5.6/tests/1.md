title: For each [data table](#data-table), each [column header](#column-or-row-header) applying to the entire column satisfies any of these conditions?
steps:
  - The [column header](#column-or-row-header) is structured using a `<th>` tag.
  - The [column header](#column-or-row-header) is structured using a tag with a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="columnheader"`.
---

1. Find the data tables in the document.
2. For each column header that applies to the entire column, verify that the column header is structured using:
   - either an element `<th>`;
   - or an element with a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="columnheader"`.
3. If this is the case for each column header applying to the entire column, **the test is validated**.
