title: For each [data table](#data-table), is each header that does not apply to the entire row or column structured using a `<th tag >`?
---

1. Find the data tables in the document.
2. For each header that does not apply to the entire row or column, verify that the row header is structured using a `<th>` element.
3. If this is the case for each header not applying to the entire row or column, **the test is validated**.
