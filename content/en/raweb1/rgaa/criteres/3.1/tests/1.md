1. Find in the document the information given by the color in a word or a set of words.
2. For each of this information, check that there is another way to retrieve this information (presence of a title attribute, an icon or a graphic effect of shape or position, a typographic effect, etc.).
3. If this is the case for each piece of information, **the test is validated**.
