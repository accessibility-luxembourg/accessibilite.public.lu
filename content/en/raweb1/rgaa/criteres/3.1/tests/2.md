title: For each indication of color given by a text, the [information](#information-given-by-color) must not be given solely by the color. Has this rule been followed?

1. Find in the document the information given by the color in a text.
2. For each of this information, check that there is another way to retrieve this information (presence of a title attribute, an icon or a graphic effect of shape or position, a typographic effect, etc.).
3. If this is the case for each piece of information, **the test is validated**.
