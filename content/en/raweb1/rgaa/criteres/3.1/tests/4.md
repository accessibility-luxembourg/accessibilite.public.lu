title: For each [CSS property determining a color](#css-property-determining-a-color) and [conveying information](#image-conveying-information-given-by-the-color), the [information](#information-given-by-color) should not be given only by color. Has this rule been followed?

1. Find the information given by the color in a CSS property in the document.
2. For each of this information, check that there is another way to retrieve this information (presence of a title attribute, an icon or a graphic effect of shape or position, a typographic effect, etc.).
3. If this is the case for each piece of information, **the test is validated**.
