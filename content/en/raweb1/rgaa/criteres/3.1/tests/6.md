title: For each [non-time-based media](#non-temporal-media) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information-given-by-color), the [information](#information-given-by-color) must not be given only by color. Has this rule been followed?

1. Find in the document the information given by color in a non-time-based media.
2. For each of this information, check that there is another way to retrieve this information (presence of a title attribute, an icon or a graphic effect of shape or position, a typographic effect, etc.).
3. If this is the case for each piece of information, **the test is validated**.
