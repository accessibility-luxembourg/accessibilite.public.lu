title: In each web page, does each [text link](#text-link) indicated only by color, and whose nature is not obvious, satisfy these conditions?
steps:
  - The link color has a [contrast](#contrast) ratio greater than or equal to 3:1 compared to the surrounding text.
  - The link has a visual indication on hover other than a change of color.
  - The link has a visual indication of focus other than a color change.

1. Find the link type elements in the document (`<a>` element or element with a WAI-ARIA `role="link"` attribute).
2. For each link type element, if it can be confused with normal text when indicated only by color, check that the contrast between the font color of the link and the font color of the surrounding text is 3:1, at least.
3. This check must be done for the different states of the link if they are presented using a different color: the unvisited state, the visited state, the activated state, the hover state and the state when focus is taken.
4. If this is the case for each link type element, **the test is validated**.
