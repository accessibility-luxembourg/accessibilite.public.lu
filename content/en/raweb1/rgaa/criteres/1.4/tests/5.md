title: For each embedded image (`<embed>` tag with the `type="image/…"` attribute) used as [CAPTCHA](#captcha) or as a \[test image](#image-test), with a \[textual alternative](#textual-image-alternative) or [alternative content](#alternative-content), is this alternative relevant?
steps:
  - If present, the content of the `title` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the content of the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute is relevant.
  - If present, the [text passage](#text-passage-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) associated via the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-labelledby` is relevant .
  - If present, [alternative content](#alternative-content) is relevant.

1. Find in the document the `<embed>` elements provided with the `type="image/..."` attribute and a textual alternative, and used as CAPTCHA or as a test image.
2. For each `<embed>` element with the `type="image/…"` attribute, check that the textual alternative is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
