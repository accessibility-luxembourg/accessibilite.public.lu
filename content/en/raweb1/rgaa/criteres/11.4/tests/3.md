1. Find in the document the form fields which are `<input>` of type `checkbox` or of type `radio` or elements having a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="checkbox"`, `role="radio "` or `role="switch"`.
2. For each form field, check that the label is visually attached:
   - Immediately below or to the right of the form field when the reading direction of the label language is left to right.
   - Immediately below or to the left of the form field when the reading direction of the label language is from right to left.
3. If this is the case for each form field, **the test is validated**.
