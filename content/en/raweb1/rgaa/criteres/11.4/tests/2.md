title: Each [label](#form-field-label) [adjoined](#label-and-adjacent-field) to a [field](#form-entry-field) (except for checkboxes, radio buttons or tags having a WAI-ARIA `role="checkbox"`, `role="radio"` or `role="switch"` attribute), does it check these conditions (except in special cases)?
steps:
  - The label is visually [adjoined](#accoles-etiquette-and-field-accoles) immediately above or to the left of the [form field](#form-entry-field) when the direction of Reading the label language is from left to right.
  - The label is visually [adjoined](#accoles-etiquette-et-field-accoles) immediately above or to the right of the [form field](#form-entry-field) when the direction of Reading the label language is from right to left.

1. Find in the document the form fields which are not `<input>` elements of type `checkbox` or type `radio` or elements having a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="checkbox"`, ` role="radio"` or `role="switch"`.
2. For each form field, check that the label is visually attached:
   - Immediately above or to the left of the form field when the reading direction of the label language is left to right.
   - Immediately above or to the right of the form field when the reading direction of the label language is from right to left.
3. If this is the case for each form field, **the test is validated**.
