title: Does each additional content that appears when focusing or hovering over an [interface component](#interface-component) satisfy one of these conditions (except in particular cases)?
steps:
  - The additional content remains visible until the user removes the mouse pointer or the focus from the additional content and the [interface component](#interface-component) that triggered its appearance.
  - The additional content remains visible until the user triggers an action hiding this content without moving the focus or the mouse pointer of the [interface component](#interface-component) that triggered its appearance.
  - Additional content remains visible until it is no longer valid.
---

1. Find additional content in the document that becomes visible when focusing or hovering over an interface component, with the exception of:
   - additional content controlled by the user agent (for example, tooltips associated with the `title` attribute or native validation of a form);
   - additional content becoming visible through user activation (for example, a dialog window).
2. For each additional content, check that it remains visible:
   - until the user removes the mouse pointer or focus from the additional content or interface component that triggered its appearance;
   - until the user triggers the mechanism provided to remove the additional content;
   - until the information offered by the additional content is no longer valid (for example additional content signaling the “busy” state of the interface component that the user wishes to activate or an error message reported in the form of additional content as long as the user has not corrected their entry).
3. If this is the case for each additional content, **the test is validated**.
