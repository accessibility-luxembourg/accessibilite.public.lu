title: Can each additional content that appears when hovering over an [interface component](#interface-component) be hovered over by the mouse pointer without disappearing (except in particular cases)?
---

1. Find additional content in the document that becomes visible when hovering over an interface component, with the exception of:
   - additional content controlled by the user agent (for example, tooltips associated with the title attribute or native validation of a form);
   - additional content becoming visible through user activation (for example, a dialog window).
2. For each additional content, check that it can be hovered over by the mouse pointer without disappearing.
3. If this is the case for each additional content, **the test is validated**.
