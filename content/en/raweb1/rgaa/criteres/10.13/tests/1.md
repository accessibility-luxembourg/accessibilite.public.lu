title: Can each additional content that becomes visible when focusing or hovering over an [interface component](#interface-component) be hidden by a user action without moving the focus or the mouse pointer (except particular cases)?
---

1. Find additional content in the document that becomes visible when focusing or hovering over an interface component, with the exception of:
   - Additional content controlled by the user agent (for example, tooltips associated with the `title` attribute or native validation of a form.
   - Additional content becoming visible through user activation (for example, a dialog window).
2. For each additional content, check that:
   - Either the additional content is positioned in such a way that it does not interfere with the consultation of the other informative content on which it is superimposed (including the interface component which triggered its appearance), whatever the conditions of consultation (including when using a zoom mechanism).
   - Either a mechanism (on the keyboard) allows the additional content to disappear (for example, the Escape key).
3. If this is the case for each additional content, **the test is validated**.
