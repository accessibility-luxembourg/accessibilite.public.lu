title: In each web page, do the actions triggered by a pointing device on a single point on the screen satisfy one of these conditions (except in particular cases)?
steps:
  - The action is triggered when the pointing device is [released or raised](#relache-or-raise).
  - The action is triggered when the pointing device is [pressed or placed](#press-or-place) then canceled when the pointing device is [released or raised](#relache-or-raise).
  - A mechanism is available to abort (before completion of the action) or cancel (after completion) the execution of the action.

1. Find in the document the actions triggered by a pointing device on a single point on the screen.
2. For each action, check that:
   - either the action is triggered when the pointing device is released or raised;
   - either the action is triggered when the pointing device is pressed or placed and then canceled when the pointing device is released or raised;
   - either there is a mechanism to abort (before completion of the action) or cancel (after completion) the execution of the action. For example, during a drag-and-drop type interaction, releasing the pointing device must allow the current interaction to be abandoned and once the drop zone is reached, the user must remain able to cancel their interaction. deposit operation by means of a confirmation dialog (choice to confirm or cancel the deposit) or by being able to return the deposited element to its initial position.
3. If this is the case for each action triggered by means of a pointing device on a single point on the screen, **the test is validated**.
