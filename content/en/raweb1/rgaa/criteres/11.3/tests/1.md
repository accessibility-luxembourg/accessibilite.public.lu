title: Each [label](#form-field-label) associated with a [form-field](#form-entry-field) having the same function and repeated several times on the same page is it [consistent](#consistent-labels)?
---

1. Find the form fields in the document with the same function (for example several address fields).
2. For each form field, check that the labels are consistent (they allow you to understand that they are entries of identical types).
3. If this is the case for each form field, **the test is validated**.
