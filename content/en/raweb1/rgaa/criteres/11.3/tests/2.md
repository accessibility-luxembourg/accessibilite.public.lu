title: Each [label](#form-field-label) associated with a [form field](#form-input-field) having the same function and repeated in a set of pages is -it [consistent](#consistent-labels)?
---

1. Find form fields with the same function in all the pages considered (for example the input field of a search engine or the input field for subscribing to a newsletter).
2. For each form field, check that the labels are consistent (they allow you to understand that they are entries of identical types).
3. If this is the case for each form field of all the pages considered, **the test is validated**.
