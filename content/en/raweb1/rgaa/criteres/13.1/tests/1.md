title: For each web page, each [refresh process](#refresh-process) (`<object>` tag, `<embed>` tag, `<svg>` tag, `<canvas>` tag, `<meta>` tag) does it satisfy one of these conditions (except in special cases)?
steps:
  - The user can stop or restart the refresh.
  - The user can increase the time limit between two refreshes by ten times, at least.
  - The user is warned of the impending refresh and has at least twenty seconds to increase the time limit before the next refresh.
  - The time limit between two refreshes is twenty hours, at least.
---

1. Find in the document the refreshes initiated in the content by an element `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<svg>`, `<canvas>` or by an element `<meta http-equiv=" refresh" content="[counter]">` (in the `<head>` element of the page).
2. For each refresh, check that:
   - either the presence of a mechanism allows the user to stop and restart the refresh;
   - either the presence of a mechanism allows the user to increase the time limit between two refreshes by ten times, at least;
   - either the presence of a mechanism which warns the user of the imminence of the refresh, leaves at least 20 seconds for the user to increase the time limit before the next refresh;
   - or the time limit between two refreshes is twenty hours, at least.
3. If so, **the test is validated**.
