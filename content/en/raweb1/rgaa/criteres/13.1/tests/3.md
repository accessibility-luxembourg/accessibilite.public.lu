title: For each web page, does each [redirection](#redirection) process carried out via a [script](#script) verify one of these conditions (except in special cases)?
steps:
  - The user can stop or restart the redirection.
  - The user can increase the time limit before redirection by ten times, at least.
  - The user is notified of the impending redirection and has at least twenty seconds to increase the time limit before the next redirection.
  - The time limit before redirection is twenty hours, at least.
---

1. Find in the document the automatic redirections initiated by a script (in the form of a count for example).
2. For each automatic redirection, verify that:
   - Either the presence of a mechanism allows the user to stop and restart the redirection.
   - Either the presence of a mechanism allows the user to increase the time limit before refreshing by ten times, at least.
   - Either the presence of a mechanism which warns the user of the imminence of the refresh, leaving at least 20 seconds for the user to increase the time limit before the next refresh.
   - Either the time limit before redirection is twenty hours, at least.
3. If so, **the test is validated**.
