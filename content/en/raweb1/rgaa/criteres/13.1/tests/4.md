title: For each web page, does each process limiting the time of a session satisfy one of these conditions (except in special cases)?
steps:
  - User can remove the time limit.
  - User can increase the time limit.
  - The time limit before the end of the session is at least twenty hours.
---

1. Find in the document the processes limiting the time of a session (for example, after authentication).
2. For each process, verify that:
   - either the presence of a mechanism allows the user to remove the time limit;
   - either the presence of a mechanism allows the user to increase the time limit;
   - either the time limit is twenty hours, at least.
3. If so, **the test is validated**.
