#### Special cases

For this criterion, there is special case management when the text is part of the logo, a commercial name, a [CAPTCHA](#captcha), a [test-image](#test-image) or an image whose graphic accuracy would be considered essential to the proper transmission of the information conveyed by the image. In these situations, the criterion is not applicable for these elements.

#### Technical notes

Since text in vector images is real text, it is not affected by this criterion.
