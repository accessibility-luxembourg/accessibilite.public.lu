title: Each [text image](#text-image) (tag `<img>` or having a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="img"`) [information carrier](#information-bearer-image ), in the absence of a [replacement mechanism](#replacement-mechanism), must if possible be replaced by [styled text](#style-text). Is this rule respected (except in special cases)?
---

1. Find the structured text images in the document using a `<img>` element (or an element with the WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute).
2. For each image, check that:
   - either there is a replacement mechanism;
   - either the image contains text that uses a graphic effect that cannot be reproduced in CSS.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
