title: Each [text image](#text-image) SVG (`<svg>` tag) [information carrier](#image-conveying-information) and whose text is not completely structured using of `<text>` elements, in the absence of a [replacement mechanism](#replacement-mechanism), must if possible be replaced by [styled text](#text-style). Has this rule been followed (except in particular cases)?
---

1. Find in the document the vector text images (`<svg>` element) carrying information and whose text is not completely structured using `<text>` elements.
2. For each image, check that:
   - either there is a replacement mechanism;
   - either the image contains text that uses a graphic effect that cannot be reproduced in CSS.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
