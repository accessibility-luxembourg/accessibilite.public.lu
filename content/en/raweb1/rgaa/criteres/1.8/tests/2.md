title: Each button “[text image](#text-image)” (`<input>` tag with the `type="image"` attribute) [information carrier](#information-bearer-image), in the absence of a [replacement mechanism](#replacement-mechanism), must if possible be replaced by [styled text](#style-text). Has this rule been followed (except in particular cases)?

1. Find the “text images” buttons in the document (element `<input>` with the attribute `type="image"`).
2. For each image, check that:
   - either there is a replacement mechanism;
   - either the image contains text that uses a graphic effect that cannot be reproduced in CSS.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
