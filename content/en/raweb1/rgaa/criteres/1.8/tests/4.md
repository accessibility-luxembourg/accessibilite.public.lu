title: Each [text image](#text-image) embedded (`<embed>` tag with the `type="image/..."` attribute) [information carrier](#information-carrier-image), in the absence of a [replacement mechanism](#replacement-mechanism), must if possible be replaced by [styled text](#style-text). Has this rule been followed (except in particular cases)?
---

1. Find the embedded text images in the document (`<embed>` element with the `type="image/â€¦"` attribute).
2. For each image, check that:
   - Either there is a replacement mechanism;
   - Either the image contains text that uses a graphic effect that cannot be reproduced in CSS.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
