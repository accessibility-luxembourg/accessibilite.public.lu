title: Each [text image](#text-image) object (tag `<object>` with the attribute `type="image/..."`) [information carrier](#information-carryer-image ), in the absence of a [replacement mechanism](#replacement-mechanism), must if possible be replaced by [styled text](#style-text). Is this rule respected (except in special cases)?
---

1. Find the object text images in the document (`<object>` element with the `type="image/â€¦"` attribute).
2. For each image, check that:
   - either there is a replacement mechanism;
   - either the image contains text that uses a graphic effect that cannot be reproduced in CSS.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
