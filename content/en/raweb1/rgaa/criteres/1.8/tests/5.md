title: Each [text image](#text-image) bitmap (`<canvas>` tag) [information carrier](#information-carrying-image), in the absence of a [replacement mechanism ](#replacement-mechanism), should if possible be replaced by [styled text](#style-text). Is this rule respected (except in special cases)?
---

1. Find the bitmap text images in the document (`<canvas>` element).
2. For each image, check that:
   - either there is a replacement mechanism;
   - either the image contains text that uses a graphic effect that cannot be reproduced in CSS.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
