title: Do error messages providing an instruction or indication of the data type and/or mandatory format of the fields satisfy any of these conditions?
steps:
  - The error message providing an instruction or indication of the type of data and/or format required is visible and identifies the field concerned.
  - The field has the `aria-invalid="true"` attribute.
---

1. Find error messages in the document providing an instruction or indication of the data type and/or mandatory format of a field.
2. For each error message, check that:
   - either the error message is visible and allows the field concerned to be identified by name;
   - either the field associated with the error message has an attribute `aria-invalid="true"`.
3. If this is the case for each error message indicating the absence of entry of a mandatory field, **the test is validated**.
