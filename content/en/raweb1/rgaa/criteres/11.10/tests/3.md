title: Do error messages indicating failure to enter a required field satisfy any of these conditions?
steps:
  - The error message indicating the absence of entry of a mandatory field is visible and allows you to identify the field concerned by name.
  - The mandatory field has the `aria-invalid="true"` attribute.
---

1. Find error messages in the document indicating the absence of entry of a mandatory field.
2. For each error message, check that:
   - either the error message is visible and allows the field concerned to be identified by name;
   - either the mandatory field associated with the error message has an attribute `aria-invalid="true"`.
3. If this is the case for each error message indicating the absence of entry of a mandatory field, **the test is validated**.
