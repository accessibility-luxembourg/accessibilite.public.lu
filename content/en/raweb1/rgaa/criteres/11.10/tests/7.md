title: Do fields with the `aria-invalid="true"` attribute whose entry requires a mandatory data type and/or format meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - An instruction or indication of the mandatory data type and/or format is visible and located in the `<label>` tag associated with the field.
  - An instruction or indication of the required data type and/or format is visible and located in the associated [text passage](#text-passage-lie-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) at the field.
---

1. Find the form fields in the document that have an `aria-invalid="true"` attribute.
2. For each form field, verify that:
   - either an instruction or an indication of the mandatory data type and/or format is visible and located in the `<label>` element associated with the field;
   - either an instruction or an indication of the mandatory data type and/or format is visible and located in the passage of text associated with the field.
3. If this is the case for each form field that has an `aria-invalid="true"` attribute, **the test is validated**.
