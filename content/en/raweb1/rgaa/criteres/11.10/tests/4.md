title: Do required fields with the `aria-invalid="true"` attribute satisfy any of these conditions?
steps:
  - The error message indicating that the entry is invalid is visible and located in the label associated with the field.
  - The error message indicating that the entry is invalid is visible and located in the [text passage](#text-passage-lie-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) associated with the field.

1. Find the mandatory form fields in the document that have an `aria-invalid="true"` attribute.
2. For each form field, verify that:
   - either the error message indicating that the entry is invalid is visible and located in the label associated with the field;
   - either the error message indicating that the entry is invalid is visible and located in the passage of text associated with the field.
3. If this is the case for each required form field that has an `aria-invalid="true"` attribute, **the test is validated**.
