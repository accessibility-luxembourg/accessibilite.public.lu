title: Do the instructions and indications of the mandatory data type and/or format satisfy any of these conditions?
steps:
  - An instruction or indication of the type of data and/or mandatory format is visible and allows the field concerned to be identified by name prior to validation of the form.
  - An instruction or indication of the required data type and/or format is visible in the label or [text passage](#text-passage-lie-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby ) associated with the field prior to validation of the form.

1. Find the mandatory form fields in the document which are associated with an instruction or indication of the type of data and/or mandatory format.
2. For each form field, check that the instruction or indication of the mandatory data type and/or format is prior to validation of the form:
   - is visible and allows the field concerned to be identified by name;
   - is visible in the label or passage of text associated with the field.
3. If this is the case for each mandatory form field to which an instruction or indication of the mandatory data type and/or format is associated, **the test is validated**.
