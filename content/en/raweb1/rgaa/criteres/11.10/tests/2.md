title: Do required fields with the `aria-required="true"` or `required` attribute satisfy any of these conditions?
steps:
  - A [mandatory field indication](#mandatory-field-indication) is visible and located in the label associated with the field prior to validation of the form.
  - A [mandatory field indication](#mandatory-field-indication) is visible and located in the [text passage](#text-passage-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) associated with the field prior to validation of the form.
---

1. Find the mandatory form fields in the document that have an `aria-required="true"` or `required` attribute.
2. For each form field, check that before validating the form:
   - either a mandatory field indication is visible and located in the label associated with the field;
   - either a mandatory field indication is visible and located in the passage of text associated with the field.
3. If this is the case for each mandatory form field that has an `aria-required="true"` or `required` attribute, **the test is validated**.
