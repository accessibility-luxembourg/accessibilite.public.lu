title: Do the [indications of obligatory nature](#indication-of-obligatory-field) of the entry of the fields satisfy one of these conditions (except in special cases)?
steps:
  - A [mandatory field indication](#mandatory-field-indication) is visible and allows you to identify the field concerned by name before validating the form.
  - The mandatory field has the `aria-required="true"` or `required` attribute prior to form validation.
---

1. Find the mandatory form fields in the document.
2. For each form field, check that before validating the form:
   - either a mandatory field indication is visible and allows the field concerned to be identified by name;
   - either the field has an `aria-required="true"` or `required` attribute.
3. If this is the case for each mandatory form field, **the test is validated**.
