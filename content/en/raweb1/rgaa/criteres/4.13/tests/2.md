title: Each [temporal media](#media-temporal-type-son-video-et-synchronise) and [non-temporal](#media-non-temporal) which has an alternative [compatible with assistive technologies]( #compatible-with-assistive-technology), does it meet any of these conditions?
steps:
  - The alternative is adjacent to [temporal media](#media-temporal-type-son-video-et-synchronise) or [non-temporal](#media-non-temporal).
  - The alternative is accessible via an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button).
  - A mechanism allows you to replace [temporal media](#temporal-media-type-son-video-et-synchronise) or [non-temporal](#non-temporal-media) by its alternative.

1. Find in the document the temporal and non-temporal media which have an alternative compatible with assistive technologies.
2. For each media, check that:
   - either the alternative is adjacent to the temporal or non-temporal media;
   - either the alternative is accessible by means of an adjacent link or button;
   - either a mechanism allows the temporal or non-temporal media to be replaced by its alternative.
3. If this is the case for each temporal or non-temporal media, **the test is validated**.
