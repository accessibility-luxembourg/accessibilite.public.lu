title: Does each [temporal media](#media-temporal-type-son-video-et-synchronise) and [non-temporal](#media-non-temporal) satisfy one of these conditions (except in special cases) ?
steps:
  - The name, role, value, configuration and state changes of interface components are accessible to assistive technologies via an accessibility API.
  - An alternative [compatible with an accessibility API](#compatible-with-assistive-technologies) allows access to the same functionalities.

1. Find temporal and non-temporal media in the document.
2. For each media, check that:
   - either the name, role, value, configuration and state changes of interface components are accessible to assistive technologies via an accessibility API (for example, dynamically updated areas in a reader video are correctly rendered);
   - either an alternative compatible with an accessibility API allows access to the same functionalities.
3. If this is the case for each temporal or non-temporal media, **the test is validated**.
