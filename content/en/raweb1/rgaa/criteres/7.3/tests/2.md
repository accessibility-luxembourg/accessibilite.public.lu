title: A [script](#script) must not remove focus from an element that receives it. Is this rule respected (except in special cases)?

1. Activate, one after the other, all the elements capable of receiving focus.
2. Verify that focus is not removed via JavaScript functionality.
3. If so, **the test is validated**.
