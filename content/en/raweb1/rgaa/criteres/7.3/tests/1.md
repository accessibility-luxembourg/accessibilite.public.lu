title: Does each element with a script-controlled event handler satisfy one of these conditions (except in special cases)?
steps:
  - The element is [accessible by the keyboard and any pointing device](#accessible-and-activatable-by-the-keyboard-and-any-pointing-device).
  - An element [accessible by the keyboard and any pointing device](#accessible-and-activable-by-the-keyboard-and-any-pointing-device) allowing the same action to be carried out is present on the page.

1. Find in the document all the elements on which a JavaScript event handler is implemented (for example click, focus, mouseover, blur, keydown, touch, etc.).
2. Check that the element is accessible using the keyboard:
   - It can be accessed with the tab key (tab).
   - If the element manages a simple action, it can be activated on the keyboard with the enter key (Enter).
   - If the element manages a complex action, it can be used with the keyboard (generally with the direction keys).
3. Otherwise, check that an element accessible by the keyboard allowing you to perform the same action is present on the page.
4. Check that the element is accessible by any pointing device (mouse, touch, stylus, etc.).
5. Otherwise, check that an element accessible by means of a pointing device and allowing the same action to be carried out is present on the page.
6. If so, **the test is validated**.
