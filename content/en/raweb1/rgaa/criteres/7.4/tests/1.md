title: Does each [script](#script) that initiates a [context-switch](#context-switch) satisfy one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The user is notified by text of the script action and the type of change before it is triggered.
  - The context change is initiated by an explicit button (input of type `submit`, `button` or `image` or `<button>` tag).
  - The context change is initiated by an explicit link.
---

1. Find in the document all the JavaScript events that initiate a context switch, for example:
   - dynamic updating of form fields;
   - opening a new page when activating an option from a selection list (element `<select>`);
   - updating, via an AJAX process, an essential part of the page;
   - automatic launch of a video player following selection of a playlist;
   - manipulation of the focus resulting in modifying the user's current position on the page.
2. Check that:
   - the user is warned by a message of the script action and the type of change before it is triggered;
   - or the context change is initiated by an explicit button (input of type submit, button or image or the button tag);
   - or the context change is initiated by an explicit link.
3. If so, **the test is validated**.
