title: In each web page, for each [non-temporal media](#non-temporal-media), the information must not be given only [by the shape, size or position](#indication-given-by-the-shape-size-or-position). Is this rule implemented appropriately?
---

1. Find in the document the information of a non-temporal media given by the shape, size or position.
2. For each information given by shape, size or position, check that the alternative means of retrieving this information is relevant, that is to say that it allows the information to be transmitted in all consultation contexts and for all users.
3. If this is the case for each piece of information, **the test is validated**.
