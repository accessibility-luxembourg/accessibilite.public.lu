title: For each web page, does the default language indication satisfy one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The indication of the language of the page (attribute `lang` and/or `xml:lang`) is given for the `html` element.
  - The indication of the language of the page (`lang` and/or `xml:lang` attribute) is given on each text element or on one of the parent elements.
---

1. Find the default language indication in the document.
2. Check for the presence of a language indication:
   - either by means of the lang attribute on the html tag if the code is HTML5 or HTML4;
   - either by means of the lang and xml:lang attributes on the html tag if the code is XHTML 1.0;
   - either by means of the xml:lang attribute on the html tag if the code is XHTML 1.1;
   - Otherwise, check the presence of a language indication on each text element or one of its parents.
3. If so, **the test is validated**.
