title: Does each web application that allows [two-way oral communication](#bidirectional-oral-communication-web-application) meet one of these conditions?
steps:
- The web application has a built-in [real-time written communication](#real-time-written-communication) functionality;
- The web application can be connected to a terminal which integrates [written communication in real time](#communication-written-in-real-time) functionality.

1. Verify that the web application allows two-way oral communication.
2. If so, check for the presence of real-time written communication functionality (sometimes it may be necessary to enable a dedicated setting in the application to enable real-time written communication).
3. Otherwise, check if the web application can connect to a terminal integrating real-time written communication functionality. This assessment can be complex to carry out without the provision of a real-time communication terminal or if the network used by the terminal does not support real-time text protocols. A first step can be to search the documentation or ask the application publisher directly.
4. If so, the test is validated.
