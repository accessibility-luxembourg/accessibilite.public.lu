1. Identify the functionalities that allow you to transmit (send content to another terminal or send a video by e-mail for example), convert (convert a video in .avi format into a .mpg format for example) or record media pre-recorded synchronized time (record a video from a broadcast platform on your personal computer for example).
2. Perform each functionality (transmit, convert and save).
3. For each feature, check if the subtitles:
   - are always present;
   - can be displayed;
   - are correctly synchronized;
   - retain their essential characteristics (for example, if the subtitles were colored according to the speaker, the colors must be adopted).
4. If so, the test is validated.
