title: For each pre-recorded audio-only [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) with a [transcript](#transcript-time-based-media), is it relevant (excluding special cases)?

1. Find in the document the pre-recorded audio-only time-based media that have a textual transcript.
2. For each audio-only time-based media, check that the text transcript is relevant.
3. If this is the case for each time-lapse media, **the test is validated**.
