title: Does each pre-recorded synchronized [time-based media](#temporal-media-type-sound-video-and-synchronize) satisfy one of these conditions (except in particular cases)?
steps:
  - The [text transcript](#temporal-media-textual-transcription) is relevant.
  - The synchronized [audio description](#audiodescription-synchronized-media-temporal) is relevant.
  - The synchronized [audio description](#audiodescription-synchronisee-media-temporal) of the alternative version is relevant.

1. Find the synchronized pre-recorded time media in the document.
2. For each synchronized time-based media, check the relevance:
   - either the verbatim transcription;
   - either synchronized audio description;
   - or the synchronized audio description of the alternative version.
3. If this is the case for each time-based media, **the test is validated**.
