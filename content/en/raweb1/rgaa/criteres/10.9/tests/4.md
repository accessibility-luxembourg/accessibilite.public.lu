title: In each web page, for each [non-temporal media](#non-temporal-media), the information must not be given only [by the shape, size or position](#indication-given-by-the -shape-size-or-position). Is this rule respected?

1. Find in the document the information of a non-temporal media given by the shape, size or position.
2. For each information given by shape, size or position, check that there is another way to retrieve this information.
3. If this is the case for each piece of information, **the test is validated**.
