title: In each web page, for each text or set of texts, the information must not be given only [by the shape, size or position](#indication-given-by-the-shape-the-size-or -theposition). Is this rule respected?

1. Find the text information in the document given by the shape, size or position.
2. For each information given by shape, size or position, check that there is another way to retrieve this information.
3. If this is the case for each piece of information, **the test is validated**.
