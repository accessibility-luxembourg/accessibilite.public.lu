title: In each web page, for each image or set of images, the information must not be given only [by shape, size or position](#indication-given-by-shape-size- or-the-position). Is this rule respected?
---

1. Find in the document the information of an image given by the shape, size or position.
2. For each information given by shape, size or position, check that there is another way to retrieve this information.
3. If this is the case for each piece of information, **the test is validated**.
