title: In each web page, for each [time-based media](#media-temporal-type-son-video-et-synchronise), the information must not be given only [by the shape, size or position](#indication-given-by-shape-size-or-position). Has this rule been followed?

1. Find in the document the information of a time-based media given by the shape, size or position.
2. For each information given by shape, size or position, check that there is another way to retrieve this information.
3. If this is the case for each piece of information, **the test is validated**.
