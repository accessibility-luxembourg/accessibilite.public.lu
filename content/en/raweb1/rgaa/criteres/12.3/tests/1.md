title: Is the [sitemap page](#sitemap-page) representative of the general architecture of the site?
---

1. Check that the site plan is representative of the general architecture of the site (see note).
2. If so, **the test is validated**.

Note: A sitemap that is too complex or too deep is not recommended to help with navigation. It is not mandatory that all pages be present in the sitemap if they can be reached, for example, from the home page of a section or catalog.
