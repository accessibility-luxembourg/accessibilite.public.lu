1. Find the temporal media in the document.
2. For each time-based media, check the presence of the mandatory consultation control functionalities:
   - at least: play, pause or stop;
   - if the media has sound, it must have sound on/off functionality;
   - if the media has subtitles, it must have functionality to control the appearance/disappearance of subtitles;
   - if the media has audio description, it must have functionality to control the appearance/disappearance of the audio description.
3. If this is the case for each temporal media, **the test is validated**.
