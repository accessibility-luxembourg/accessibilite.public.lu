title: For each [temporal media](#temporal-media-type-sound-video-and-synchronizes), does each feature satisfy one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The functionality is [accessible by the keyboard and any pointing device](#accessible-and-activatable-by-the-keyboard-and-any-pointing-device).
  - A functionality [accessible by the keyboard and any pointing device](#accessible-and-activable-by-the-keyboard-and-any-pointing-device) allowing the same action to be performed is present on the page.

1. Find the time-based media with control functionalities in the document.
2. For each temporal media, verify that:
   - either the functionality is accessible via the keyboard and any pointing device;
   - either a functionality accessible via the keyboard and any pointing device allowing the same action to be carried out is present on the page.
3. If this is the case for each temporal media, **the test is validated**.
