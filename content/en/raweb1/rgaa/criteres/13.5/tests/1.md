title: In each web page, does each cryptic content (ASCII art, emoticon, cryptic syntax) satisfy one of these conditions?
steps:
  - A title attribute is available.
  - A definition is given by the adjacent context.
---

1. Find cryptic content in the document (ASCII art, emoticon, cryptic syntax).
2. For each cryptic content, verify that:
   - Either a definition is available using a `title` attribute, on a link, a form control, an abbreviation (`<abbr>` element) for example.
   - Either a definition is given in the adjacent context (immediately before or after).
3. If this is the case for each cryptic content, **the test is validated**.
