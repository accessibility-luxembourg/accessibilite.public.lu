title: Does each pre-recorded synchronized [time-based media](#temporal-media-type-sound-video-and-synchronize) verify, if necessary, one of these conditions (except in particular cases)?
steps:
  - There is a synchronized [audio description](#audiodescription-synchronized-media-temporal).
  - There is an alternative version with a synchronized [audio description](#audiodescription-synchronized-media-temporal).
---

1. Find the synchronized pre-recorded time-based media in the document that require audio description.
2. For each synchronized time-based media, check the presence of:
   - either synchronized audio description;
   - Or an alternative version with a synchronized audio description accessible by means of a button or an adjacent link (a URL or an anchor).
3. If this is the case for each synchronized time media, **the test is validated**.
