title: Does each pre-recorded video-only [temporal media](#temporal-media-type-sound-video-and-synchronize) verify, if necessary, one of these conditions (except in special cases)?
steps:
  - There is a synchronized [audiodescription](#audiodescription-synchronized-media-temporal).
  - There is an alternative version with a synchronized [audiodescription](#audiodescription-synchronized-media-temporal).
---

1. Find pre-recorded video-only temporal media in the document that require audio description.
2. For each video-only temporal media, check the presence of:
   - either synchronized audio description;
   - or an alternative version with a synchronized audio description accessible by means of a button or an adjacent link (a URL or an anchor).
3. If this is the case for each temporal video-only media, **the test is validated**.
