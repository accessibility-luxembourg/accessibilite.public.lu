title: Does each form whose validation modifies or deletes financial, legal or personal data meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - A mechanism allows you to recover data deleted or modified by the user.
  - A mechanism for requesting explicit confirmation of the deletion or modification, via a [form field](#form-entry-field) or an additional step, is proposed.
---

1. Find the forms in the document that modify or delete financial, legal or personal data.
2. For each form, check that the user has:
   - either a mechanism that allows deleted or modified data to be recovered;
   - either a mechanism for requesting explicit confirmation of the deletion or modification (for example, a check box or an additional step).
3. If this is the case for each form found, **the test is validated**.
