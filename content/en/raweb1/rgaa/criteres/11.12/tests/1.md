title: For each form that modifies or deletes data, or that transmits answers to a test or exam, or whose validation has financial or legal consequences, does the data entry satisfy one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The user can [modify or cancel the data and the actions performed](#modify-or-cancel-the-data-and-the-actions-performed) on this data after validation of the form.
  - The user can check and correct the data before validating a form in several steps.
  - An explicit confirmation mechanism, via a checkbox (`<input>` tag of `checkbox` type or tag with a WAI-ARIA `role="checkbox"` attribute) or an additional step, is present.
---

1. Find in the document the forms which modify or delete data, or which transmit answers to a test or examination, or whose validation has financial or legal consequences.
2. For each form, check that the user can:
   - either modify or cancel the data and the actions carried out on this data after validation of the form;
   - either check and correct the data before validating a form in several stages;
   - either have an explicit confirmation mechanism (for example, a checkbox or an additional step).
3. If this is the case for each form found, **the test is validated**.
