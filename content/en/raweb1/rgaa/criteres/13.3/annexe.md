#### Special cases

There is special case management:

- If the office files (e.g. PDF, Microsoft or LibreOffice documents, etc.) were published before September 23, 2018 (unless these contents are necessary for the purposes of active administrative processes relating to tasks carried out by the sector body public concerned), they are exempt from the accessibility obligation, according to the law of [May 28, 2019](http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2019/05/28 /a373/jo)

In this situation, the criterion is not applicable.

In the case of PDF documents, if there is no accessible alternative version, they must comply with the [reference for evaluating the accessibility of documents in PDF format (RAPDF)](../rapdf1/ index.html).
