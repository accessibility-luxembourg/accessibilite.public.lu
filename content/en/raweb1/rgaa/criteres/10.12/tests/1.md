title: In each web page, does the text remain readable when the display is modified according to these conditions (except in special cases)?
steps:
  - Line spacing (`line-height`) is increased to 1.5 times the font size.
  - The spacing following paragraphs (`<p>` tag) is increased to twice the font size.
  - Letter-spacing is increased to 0.12 times the font size.
  - Word-spacing is increased to 0.16 times the font size.
---

1. Modify the document styles by giving:
   - a value of 1.5 to the `line-height` property of all elements of the document;
   - a value of 2em to the `margin-bottom` property of `<p>` elements;
   - a value of 0.12em to the `letter-spacing` property of all elements of the document;
   - a value of 0.16em to the `word-spacing` property of all elements of the document.
2. For each passage of text, check that it remains readable, except:
   - subtitles directly integrated into a video;
   - text images;
   - texts within a `<canvas>` tag.
3. If this is the case for each passage of text, **the test is validated**.

Note: An implementation of these modification rules is available in the WCAG 1.4.12 Success Criterion resources (https://github.com/alastc/adaptation-scripts/blob/master/scripts/text-adaptation.js).
