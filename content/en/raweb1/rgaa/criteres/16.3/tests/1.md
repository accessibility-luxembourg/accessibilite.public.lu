1. Identify the presence of documentation provided by the assistance service.
2. Check for each item of documentation:
- if it is a web page (HTML, CSS), that it respects the [RAWeb](../raweb1/criteres.html);
- if it is an office document in PDF format, that it complies with the [reference for evaluating the accessibility of documents in PDF format (RAPDF)](../rapdf1/index.html);
- if it is a non-web document which is not in PDF format, it complies with the criteria of [section 10 Non-web documents](https://www.etsi.org/deliver /etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf#page=52) of the European standard EN 301 549 v3.2.1.
3. If so, the test is validated.
