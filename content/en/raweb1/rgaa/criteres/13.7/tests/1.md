title: In each web page, each image or multimedia element (`<video>` tag, `<img>` tag, `<svg>` tag, `<canvas>` tag, `<embed>` tag or ` tag Does <object>`) that causes an abrupt change in brightness or a flash effect satisfy any of these conditions?
steps:
  - The frequency of the effect is less than 3 per second.
  - The total cumulative surface area of the effects is less than or equal to 21824 pixels.

1. Find content in the document that flashes or causes flash effects such as an animated image, video (see note) or animation (elements `<img>`, `<svg>`, `<canvas>`, ` <embed>`, `<object>` or `<video>`).
2. For each content that flashes or causes flash effects, verify that:
   - either the frequency of the effect is less than 3 per second;
   - or the cumulative surface is less than 21824 pixels.
3. If this is the case for each content that flashes or causes flash effects, **the test is validated**.

Note: the evaluation of this criterion can be complex. When the effect is managed by a script or by means of CSS, code analysis is sufficient. The PEAT tool allows you to analyze videos in .avi format, for example. An example of a video that caused seizures can be seen here: <span lang="en">[London 2012 Olympics Seizure](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vs0hfhSje9M)</span >.
