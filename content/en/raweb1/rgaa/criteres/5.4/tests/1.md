title: For each [titled data table](#titled-data table), is the title correctly associated with the data table?
---

1. Find the data tables in the document with a title.
2. For each title, verify that it is provided using:
   - either a `<caption>` element;
   - either a `title` attribute;
   - either a WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute;
   - or a WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute referencing a passage of text.
3. If this is the case for each data table title, **the test is validated**.
