#### Special cases

There is special case management on language change for the following cases:

- Proper name, the criterion is not applicable;
- Common foreign language name present in the official dictionary of the language (see note 1 below) by default of the web page, the criterion is not applicable;
- The foreign language term submitted, via a [form field](#form-entry-field) and recalled on the page (for example as an indication of the searched term in the case of a search engine) , the criterion is not applicable;
- Passage of text whose language cannot be determined: the criterion is not applicable;
- Term or passage of text from a dead or imaginary language for which there is no vocal interpretation: the criterion is not applicable.

Note 1: the official dictionaries for languages frequently used on Luxembourg public sites are as follows:

- for Luxembourgish: [Lëtzebuerger Online Dictionary (LOD)](https://lod.lu/){lang="lb"} (use of [spellchecker.lu](https://spellchecker.lu/) can help detect words missing from the dictionary);
- for French: [Computerized French Language Treasure](http://atilf.atilf.fr/tlfi.htm);
- for German: [Digitales Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache](https://www.dwds.de){lang="de"};
- for English: [Oxford English Dictionary](https://www.oed.com){lang="en"}.

Note 2: for common foreign language nouns, absent in the official dictionary of the default language of the web page, and which have passed into the common language (example: newsletter): the criterion is applicable, only when the absence language indication can cause misunderstanding of the restitution.
