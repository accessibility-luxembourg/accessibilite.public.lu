title: Does each identification or control functionality that relies on the use of [biological characteristics](#biological-characteristic) of the user meet one of these conditions?
steps:
- There is an alternative that does not rely on a biological characteristic of the user.
- There is an alternative which is based on a biological characteristic of the user which is sufficiently different from the biological characteristic initially requested.
---
1. Identify on the page the identification (authentication) and control functionalities which use biological characteristics (voice recognition, fingerprint, facial recognition, etc.).
2. Check that there is an alternative method to perform the action:
- For an authentication feature that uses fingerprint recognition, a button is available on the login page to access password entry.
- For an authentication feature that uses voice recognition, the website also offers fingerprint recognition.
3. If so, the test is validated.

If the alternative method also relies on a biological characteristic, it is essential that it does not use a similar biological characteristic. For example, if the initial method relies on voice, the alternative method should not use voice.
