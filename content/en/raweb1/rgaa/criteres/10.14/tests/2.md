title: In each web page, does the additional content appearing in the focus of an [interface component](#interface-component) via CSS styles comply with one of these conditions if necessary?
steps:
  - Additional content also appears when the component is activated via the keyboard and any pointing device.
  - Additional content also appears when hovering over the component.
  - Additional content also appears when activating or hovering over another component.
---

1. Find in the document the additional content that becomes visible when an interface component takes focus using a CSS mechanism (`pseudo-class:focus`).
2. For each additional content, check that the additional content also appears:

- When activating the component using the keyboard or any other pointing device.
- When hovering over the component.
- When activating or hovering over another component.

3. If this is the case for each additional content, **the test is validated**.
