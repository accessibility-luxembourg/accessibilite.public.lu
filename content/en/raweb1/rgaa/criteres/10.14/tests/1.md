title: In each web page, does the additional content appearing when hovering over an [interface component](#interface-component) via CSS styles comply with one of these conditions if necessary?
steps:
  - Additional content also appears when the component is activated via the keyboard and any pointing device.
  - Additional content also appears when the component takes focus.
  - Additional content also appears through the activation or focus of another component.
---

1. Find additional content in the document that becomes visible when hovering over an interface component using a CSS mechanism (`pseudo-class:hover`).
2. For each additional content, check that the additional content also appears:
   - When activating the component using the keyboard or any other pointing device.
   - When taking focus of the component.
   - When activating or taking focus from another component.
3. If this is the case for each additional content, **the test is validated**.
