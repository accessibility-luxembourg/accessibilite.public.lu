title: Does each [text link](#text-link) meet one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - The [accessible name of a link](#title-or-accessible-name-of-link) alone makes it possible to understand its function and destination.
  - The [accessible name of a link](#title-or-accessible-name-of-link) added to the [link context](#link-context) enables us to understand the function and destination of the link.
---

1. Find the text links in the document.
2. For each text link, check that the information used to understand the function and destination of the link is
   - either the title of the link alone;
   - or the link context.
3. If this is the case for each text link, **the test is validated**.
