title: Does each [text link](#text-link) satisfy one of these conditions (except in special cases)?
steps:
  - The [link title](#title-or-accessible-link-name) alone allows us to understand its function and destination.
  - The [link title](#title-or-accessible-name-of-link) added to the [link context](#link-context) allows us to understand its function and destination.
---

1. Find the text links in the document.
2. For each text link, check that what allows you to understand its function and destination is:
   - either the title of the link alone;
   - or the context of the link.
3. If this is the case for each text link, **the test is validated**.
