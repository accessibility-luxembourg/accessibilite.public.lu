title: Does each [composite link](#composite-link) satisfy one of these conditions (except in particular cases)?
steps:
  - The [link title](#title-or-accessible-link-name) alone allows us to understand its function and destination.
  - The [link title](#title-or-accessible-name-of-link) added to the [link context](#link-context) allows us to understand its function and destination.
---

1. Find the composite links in the document (link composed of both text content and image elements).
2. For each composite link, check that what allows you to understand its function and destination is:
   - either the title of the link alone, provided by the combination of the text content and the textual alternative of the image;
   - or the context of the link.
3. If this is the case for each composite link, **the test is validated**.
