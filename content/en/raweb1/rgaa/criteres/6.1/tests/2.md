title: Does each [image link](#image-link) satisfy one of these conditions (except in special cases)?
steps:
  - The [link title](#title-or-accessible-link-name) alone allows us to understand its function and destination.
  - The [link title](#title-or-accessible-name-of-link) added to the [link context](#link-context) allows us to understand its function and destination.

1. Find the image links in the document (link with content of an `<img>` element or an element with the WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute, a `<area>` element with an ` attribute href`, an `<object>` element, a `<canvas>` element or a `<svg>` element).
2. For each image link, check that what allows you to understand its function and destination is:
   - either the title of the link alone, provided by the textual alternative of the image;
   - or the context of the link.
3. If this is the case for each image link, **the test is validated**.
