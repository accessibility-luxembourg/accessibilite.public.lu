title: Does each [SVG link](#svg-link) satisfy one of these conditions (except in special cases)?
steps:
  - The [link title](#title-or-accessible-link-name) alone allows us to understand its function and destination.
  - The [link title](#title-or-accessible-name-of-link) added to the [link context](#link-context) allows us to understand its function and destination.

1. Find the SVG links in the document (`<svg>` element which has an `<a>` element with an `xlink-href` (SVG 1.1) or `href` (SVG 2) attribute).
2. For each SVG link, check that what allows you to understand its function and destination is:
   - either the title of the link alone, provided by the accessible name of the `<svg>` element (generally resolved from the content of a `<text>` element);
   - or the context of the link.
3. If this is the case for each SVG link, **the test is validated**.
