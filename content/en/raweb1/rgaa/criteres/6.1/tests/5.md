title: For each [link](#link) having a [visible title](#visible-title), does the [accessible link name](#title-or-accessible-link-name) contain at least the [visible title](#visible-title) (except in special cases)?

1. Find in the document the links other than SVG whose content is provided both by a visible title and by the content of either a title attribute or an `aria-label` attribute or an `aria attribute -labelledby`.
2. For each link, check that the content of the `title` attribute or the `aria-label` attribute or the `aria-labelledby` attribute contains the visible title.
3. If this is the case for each link, **the test is validated** for links other than SVG.
4. Find in the document the SVG links whose content is provided both by a visible title and by the content of either an `aria-labelledby` attribute, or an `aria-label` attribute or a title element (direct child of the `<svg>` element) or an x-link:title attribute (SVG 1.1) or one or more `<text>` elements.
5. For each SVG link, verify that the contents of the `aria-labelledby` attribute or the `aria-label` attribute or the `<title>` element or the `x-link attribute: title` or one or more `<text>` elements contains the visible title.
6. If this is the case for each SVG link, **the test is validated** for the SVG links.
7. If the test is validated for both non-SVG links and SVG links, the test is globally validated.
