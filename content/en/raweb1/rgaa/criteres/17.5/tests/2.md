title: For each [two-way oral communication web application](#two-way-oral-communication-web-application) that has real-time video, is a visual indicator of oral activity present?
---

1. Verify that the web application supports two-way oral communication and real-time video streaming.
2. If this is the case, activate the application on two terminals and connect them to the same session.
3. Make a user speak from one of the terminals.
4. Check the interface for the appearance of a visual indicator to identify that a person is speaking. It is not necessary for this criterion to identify who is speaking, but simply to identify that there is a person who is speaking. For example, a halo around or an icon near the avatar of the person speaking.
5. If so, the test is validated.
