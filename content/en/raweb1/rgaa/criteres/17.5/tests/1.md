title: For each [oral communication web application](#bidirectional-oral-communication-web-application) and [real-time written](#real-time-written-communication), a visual indicator of the is oral activity present?
---

1. Verify that the web application allows two-way oral communication and written communication in real time.
2. If this is the case, activate the web application on two terminals and connect them to the same session.
3. Make a user speak from one of the terminals.
4. Check the interface for the appearance of a visual indicator to identify that a person is speaking. It is not necessary for this criterion to identify who is speaking, but simply to identify that there is a person who is speaking. For example, a halo around or an icon near the avatar of the person speaking.
5. If so, the test is validated.
