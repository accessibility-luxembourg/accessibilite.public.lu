title: In each web page, the ratio of [contrast](#contrast) of the different colors composing a [graphic element](#graphic-element), when they are necessary for its understanding, and the [background color contiguous plane](#contiguous-background-color-and-contiguous-color), does it satisfy one of these conditions (except in particular cases)?
steps:
  - The ratio of [contrast](#contrast) is 3:1, at least.
  - A [mechanism](#mechanism-that-allows-to-display-a-compliant-contrast-ratio) allows a [contrast](#contrast) ratio of 3:1, at least.

1. Find graphic elements in the document that could cause contrast problems.
2. For each of these elements, check that:
   - either the contrast ratio between the colors of the graphic element necessary for its understanding and the adjoining background color is at least 3:1;
   - either a mechanism allows the user to display the graphic element with a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.
3. If this is the case for each component, **the test is validated**.
