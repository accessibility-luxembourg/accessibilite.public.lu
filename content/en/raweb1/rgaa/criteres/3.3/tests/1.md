title: In each web page, the ratio of [contrast](#contrast) between the colors of an [interface component](#interface-component) in its different states and the [background color contiguous](#contiguous-background-color-and-contiguous-color) satisfy one of these conditions (except in special cases)?
steps:
  - The ratio of [contrast](#contrast) is 3:1, at least.
  - A [mechanism](#mechanism-that-allows-to-display-a-compliant-contrast-ratio) allows a [contrast](#contrast) ratio of 3:1, at least.

1. Find the interface components in the document that could cause contrast problems.
2. For each of these components, check that:
   - either the contrast ratio between the colors of the component in its different states and the contiguous background color is 3:1, at least;
   - either a mechanism allows the user to display the component with a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.
3. If this is the case for each component, **the test is validated**.
