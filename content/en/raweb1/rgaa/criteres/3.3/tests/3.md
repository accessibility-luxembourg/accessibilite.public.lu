title: In each web page, the ratio of [contrast](#contrast) of the different [contiguous colors](#contiguous-background-color-and-contiguous-color) to each other of a [graphic element] (#graphic-element), when they are necessary for its understanding, does it verify one of these conditions (except in special cases)?
steps:
  - The ratio of [contrast](#contrast) is 3:1, at least.
  - A [mechanism](#mechanism-that-allows-to-display-a-compliant-contrast-ratio) allows a [contrast](#contrast) ratio of 3:1, at least.

1. Find graphic elements in the document that could cause contrast problems.
2. For each of these elements, check that:
   - either the contrast ratio of the different contiguous colors of the graphic element to each other, when they are necessary for its understanding, is 3:1, at least;
   - either a mechanism allows the user to display the graphic element with a contrast ratio of at least 3:1.
3. If this is the case for each graphic element, **the test is validated**.
