title: In the compliant [mechanism which makes it possible to display a contrast ratio](#mechanism-which-allows-to-display-a-compliant-contrast-ratio), are the colors of the component or graphic elements conveying information that compose it sufficiently contrasted?

1. Find in the document the mechanisms that allow you to display a consistent contrast ratio.
2. For each of these mechanisms, check that the contrast ratio between the colors of the component or the graphic element conveying informations that compose it is sufficiently high.
3. If this is the case for each mechanism, **the test is validated**.
