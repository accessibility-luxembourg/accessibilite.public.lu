title: In the compliant [mechanism which makes it possible to display a contrast ratio](#mechanism-which-allows-to-display-a-compliant-contrast-ratio), the colors of the component or graphic elements carrying The information that composes it, is it sufficiently contrasted?

1. Find in the document the mechanisms that allow you to display a consistent contrast ratio.
2. For each of these mechanisms, check that the contrast ratio between the colors of the component or the information-carrying graphic elements that compose it is sufficiently high.
3. If this is the case for each mechanism, **the test is validated**.
