title: For each web application that allows [bidirectional oral communication](#web-application-of-oral-bidirectional-communication) and [written in real time](#written-communication-in-real-time), both modes usable simultaneously?
---

1. Verify that the web application allows two-way oral communication.
2. If so, check for the presence of real-time written communication functionality.
3. If this is the case, check that it is possible to use both communication modes at the same time, that is to say that it is possible for the same user to speak and use simultaneously the real-time written communication system.
4. If so, the test is validated.
