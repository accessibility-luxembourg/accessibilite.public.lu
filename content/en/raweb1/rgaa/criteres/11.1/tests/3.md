title: Each [form field](#form-input-field) having a [label](#form-field-label) whose content is not visible or nearby (hidden , `aria-label`) or which is not [attached](#accoles-etiquette-et-field-accoles) to the field (`aria-labelledby`), does it satisfy one of its conditions?
steps:
  - The [form field](#form-entry-field) has a `title` attribute whose content allows you to understand the nature of the expected input.
  - The [form field](#form-entry-field) is accompanied by a [text passage](#text-passage-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby ) attached to the field which becomes visible when the focus is taken, allowing you to understand the nature of the expected entry.
  - The [form field](#form-entry-field) is accompanied by a [text passage](#text-passage-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby ) visible next to the field allowing you to understand the nature of the expected entry.

1. Find in the document the form fields whose label is not visible or nearby (hidden, use of the aria-label attribute) or is not attached to the field (use of the `aria attribute -labeledby`).
2. For each form field, verify that the form field:
   - either has a `title` attribute whose content allows us to understand the nature of the expected entry;
   - is accompanied by a passage of text attached to the field which becomes visible when the focus is taken, making it possible to understand the nature of the expected entry;
   - is accompanied by a visible passage of text attached to the field allowing you to understand the nature of the expected entry.
