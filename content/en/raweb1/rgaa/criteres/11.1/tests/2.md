title: Does each [form field](#form-input-field) associated with a `<label>` tag having a `for` attribute satisfy these conditions?
steps:
  - The [form field](#form-input-field) has an `id` attribute.
  - The value of the `for` attribute is equal to the value of the `id` attribute of the associated [form field](#form-input-field).
---

1. Find the form fields associated with a `<label>` element in the document.
2. For each form field, verify that:
   - The form field has an `id` attribute.
   - The value of the `for` attribute of the `<label>` element is equal to the value of the `id` attribute.
3. If this is the case for the form field, **the test is validated**.
