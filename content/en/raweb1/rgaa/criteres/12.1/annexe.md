#### Special cases

There is special case management when the website consists of a single page or a very limited number of pages (see note). In this case, the criterion is not applicable.

The criterion is also not applicable for pages in a set of pages which are the result or part of a process (a payment or order taking process, for example).

Note: the appreciation of a very limited number of pages should be reserved for a site where all of the pages are accessible from the home page.
