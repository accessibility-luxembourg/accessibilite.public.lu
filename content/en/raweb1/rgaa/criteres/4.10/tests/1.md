title: Does each sound sequence automatically triggered via a `<object>`, `<video>`, `<audio>`, `<embed>`, `<bgsound>` tag or JavaScript code check one of These conditions ?
steps:
  - The sound sequence has a duration less than or equal to 3 seconds.
  - The sound sequence can be stopped by user action.
  - The volume of the sound sequence can be controlled by the user independently of the system volume control.

1. When loading the document, if a sound is triggered automatically, check that:
   - either the sound sequence has a duration less than or equal to 3 seconds;
   - either a device (a button for example), on the element that triggered the sound (see note), or on the page, allows it to be stopped;
   - either the volume of the sequence can be controlled by the user, independently of the system volume control.
2. If so, **the test is validated**.

Note: the following elements may trigger sounds when the page loads: `<audio>`, `<video>`, `<object>`, `<embed>`, `<bgsound>` elements or code JavaScript (using the Web Audio API, for example).
