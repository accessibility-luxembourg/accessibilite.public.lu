title: Does each button of type `image` (`<input>` tag with attribute `type="image"`) have a [text alternative](#text-alternative-image)?
---

1. Find the elements in the document `<input>` with the attribute `type="image"`.
2. For each `<input>` element with the attribute type="image", determine whether the image used conveys information.
3. Check that the `<input>` element has at least one of the following text alternatives:
   - passage of associated text via the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-labelledby`;
   - content of the `aria-label` WAI-ARIA attribute;
   - content of the `alt` attribute;
   - content of the `title` attribute.
4. If at least one text alternative is found, **the test is validated**.
