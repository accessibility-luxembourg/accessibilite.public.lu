title: Does each button of type `image` (tag `<input>` with attribute `type="image"`) have a [text alternative](#text-alternative-image)?
---

1. Find the `<input>` elements in the document with the `type="image"` attribute.
2. For each `<input>` element with the type="image" attribute, determine if the image used carries information.
3. Check that the `<input>` element has at least one textual alternative among the following:
   - passage of associated text via the WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute;
   - contents of the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-label`;
   - content of the `alt` attribute;
   - content of the `title` attribute.
4. If at least one textual alternative is found, **the test is validated**.
