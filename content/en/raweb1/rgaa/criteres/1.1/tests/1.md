title: Does each image (`<img>` tag or tag with the WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute) [information carrier](#image-conveying-information) have a [textual alternative](#textual-image-alternative)?
---

1. Find the structured images in the document using a `<img>` element or an element with the WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute.
2. For each image, determine if the image carries information.
3. In the case where it is a `<img>` element, check that the image has at least one textual alternative among the following:
   - passage of associated text via the WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute;
   - contents of the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-label`;
   - content of the `alt` attribute;
   - content of the `title` attribute.
4. In the case where it is an element with the WAI-ARIA attribute `role="img"`, check that the image is provided with at least one textual alternative among the following:
   - passage of associated text via the WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute;
   - content of the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute.
5. If at least one textual alternative is found, **the test is validated**.
