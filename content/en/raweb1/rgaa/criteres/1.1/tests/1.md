title: Does each image (tag `<img>` or tag with WAI-ARIA attribute `role="img"`) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information) have a [text alternative](#text-alternative-image)?
---

1. Find in the document the structured images using a `<img>` element or an element with the WAI-ARIA attribute `role="img"`.
2. For each image, determine whether the image conveys information.
3. If it is a `<img>` element, check that the image has at least one of the following text alternatives:
   - passage of associated text via the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-labelledby`;
   - content of the `aria-label` WAI-ARIA attribute;
   - content of the `alt` attribute;
   - content of the `title` attribute.
4. In the case of an element with the WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute, check that the image has at least one of the following text alternatives:
   - passage of associated text via the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-labelledby`;
   - content of the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-label`.
5. If at least one text alternative is found, **the test is validated**.
