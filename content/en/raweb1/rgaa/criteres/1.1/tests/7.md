title: Does each embedded image (`<embed>` tag with the `type="image/..."` attribute) [information carrier](#image-carrier-d-information), verify one of These conditions ?
steps:
  - The `<embed>` tag has a [text alternative](#textual-alternative-image) and a `role="img"` attribute;
  - The `<embed>` element is immediately followed by an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) allowing access to [alternative content](#alternative-content);
  - A mechanism allows the user to replace the `<embed>` element with [alternative content](#alternative-content).
---

1. For each `<embed>` element with the `type="image/â€¦"` attribute, determine if the image used carries information.
2. Check that the `<embed>` element has a WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute.
3. Check that the `<embed>` element has at least one textual alternative among the following:
   - passage of associated text via the WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute;
   - contents of the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-label`;
   - content of the `title` attribute.
4. If at least one textual alternative is found, **the test is validated**.
5. Otherwise, check that the `<embed>` element is:
   - is immediately followed by an adjacent link or button allowing access to alternative content;
   - either a mechanism allows the user to replace the `<embed>` element with alternative content.
6. If so, **the test is validated**.
