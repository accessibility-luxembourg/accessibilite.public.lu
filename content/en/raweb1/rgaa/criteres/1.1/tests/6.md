title: Each [image object](#image-object) (tag `<object>` with the attribute `type="image/…"`) [information carrier](#image-porteuse-d-information) , does it satisfy one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The `<object>` tag has a [textual alternative](#textual-alternative-image) and an attribute `role="img"`;
  - The `<object>` element is immediately followed by an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button) allowing access to [alternative content](#alternative-content);
  - A mechanism allows the user to replace the `<object>` element with [alternative content](#alternative-content).
---

1. Find the opening tags `<object>` with the `type="image/…"` attribute in the document.
2. For each opening tag `<object>` with the `type="image/..."` attribute, determine if the image used carries information.
3. Check that the `<object>` element has a WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute.
4. Check that the `<object>` element has at least one textual alternative among the following:
   - passage of associated text via the WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute;
   - contents of the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-label`;
   - content of the `title` attribute.
5. If at least one textual alternative is found, **the test is validated**.
6. Otherwise, check that the `<object>` element is:
   - is immediately followed by an adjacent link or button allowing access to alternative content;
   - either a mechanism allows the user to replace the `<object>` element with alternative content.
7. If so, **the test is validated**.
