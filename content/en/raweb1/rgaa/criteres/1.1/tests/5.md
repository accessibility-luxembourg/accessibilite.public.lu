title: Does each vector image (tag `<svg>`) [conveying information](#image-conveying-information) meet these conditions?
steps:
  - The `<svg>` tag has a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="img"`;
  - The `<svg>` tag has a [text alternative](#text-alternative-image).
---

1. Find in the document the `<svg>` elements.
2. For each `<svg>` element, determine whether the image conveys information.
3. Check that the `<svg>` element has a WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute.
4. If this is not the case, the test is invalidated.
5. If necessary, check that the `<svg>` element has at least one of the following text alternatives:
   - content of the `<title>` element;
   - associated text passage via the WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute;
   - content of the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute;
6. If at least one text alternative is found, **the test is validated**.
