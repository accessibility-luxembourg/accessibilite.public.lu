title: Does each vector image (`<svg>` tag) [information carrier](#image-conveying-information) satisfy these conditions?
steps:
  - The `<svg>` tag has a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="img"`;
  - The `<svg>` tag has a [textual alternative](#textual-alternative-image).
---

1. Find the `<svg>` elements in the document.
2. For each `<svg>` element, determine if the image carries information.
3. Ensure that the `<svg>` element has a WAI-ARIA `role="img"` attribute.
4. If this is not the case, the test is invalidated.
5. If applicable, check that the `<svg>` element has at least one textual alternative among the following:
   - content of element `<title>`;
   - passage of associated text via the WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute;
   - contents of the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-label`;
6. If at least one textual alternative is found, **the test is validated**.
