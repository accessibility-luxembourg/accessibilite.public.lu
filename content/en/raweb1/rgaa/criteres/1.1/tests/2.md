title: Does each [area](#image-map-area) in an [image map](#image-map) (`<area>` tag) [information-conveying](#image-conveying-information) have a [text alternative](#text-alternative-image)?
---

1. Find in the document the `<area>` elements.
2. For each `<area>` element, determine whether the reactive zone carries information.
3. Check that the reactive zone has at least one of the following text alternatives:
   - value of the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute;
   - value of the `alt` attribute;
4. If at least one text alternative is found, **the test is validated**.
