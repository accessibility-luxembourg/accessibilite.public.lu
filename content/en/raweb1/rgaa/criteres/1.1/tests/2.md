1. Find the `<area>` elements in the document.
2. For each `<area>` element, determine if the responsive area carries information.
3. Check that the responsive area is provided with at least one textual alternative among the following:
   - contents of the WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-label`;
   - content of the `alt` attribute;
4. If at least one textual alternative is found, **the test is validated**.
