title: On each web page, is the hierarchy between [titles](#title) (`<hx>` tag or tag with a WAI-ARIA `role="heading"` attribute associated with a WAI-ARIA `aria-level` attribute) relevant?
---

1. Find the titles in the document (`<hx>` tag or tag with a WAI-ARIA `role="heading"` attribute associated with a WAI-ARIA `aria-level` attribute).
2. Check that the hierarchy between the titles is appropriate.
3. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.
