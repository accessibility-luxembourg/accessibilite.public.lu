title: In each web page, the hierarchy between the [titles](#title) (tag `<hx>` or tag having a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="heading"` associated with a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria- level`) is it relevant?

1. Find the titles in the document (tag `<hx>` or tag having a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="heading"` associated with a WAI-ARIA attribute `aria-level`).
2. Check that the hierarchy between titles is relevant.
3. If so, **the test is validated**.
