title: Does each pre-recorded video-only [time-based media](#temporal-media-type-sound-video-and-synchronize) verify, if necessary, one of these conditions (except in particular cases)?
steps:
  - There is an [alternative “audio-only” version](#alternative-audio-only-version) accessible via an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button).
  - There is a clearly identifiable adjacent [alternative “audio-only” version](#alternative-audio-only-version).
  - There is a [text transcript](#temporal-media-textual-transcription) accessible via an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button).
  - There is a clearly identifiable adjacent [text transcript](#temporal-media-textual-transcription).
  - There is a synchronized [audio description](#audiodescription-synchronized-media-temporal).
  - There is an alternative version with a synchronized [audio description](#temporal-media-synchronized-audiodescription) accessible via an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button).

1. Find in the document the time-based media (elements `<video>` or `<object>`) only video which require a text transcript.
2. For each video-only time-based media, check the presence of:
   - either an alternative audio version only accessible by means of an adjacent link or button (a URL or an anchor);
   - either an adjacent audio-only alternative version;
   - either a text transcript accessible by means of a button or an adjacent link (a URL or an anchor);
   - either a clearly identifiable adjacent text transcript;
   - either synchronized audio description;
   - or an alternative version with a synchronized audio description accessible by means of a button or an adjacent link (a URL or an anchor).
3. If this is the case for each time-based media, **the test is validated**.
