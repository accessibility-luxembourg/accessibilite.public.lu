title: Does each pre-recorded synchronized [temporal media](#temporal-media-type-sound-video-and-synchronize) verify, if necessary, one of these conditions (except in special cases)?
steps:
  - There is a [textual transcription](#temporal-media-textual-transcription) accessible via an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button).
  - There is a clearly identifiable adjacent [textual transcription](#temporal-media-textual-transcription).
  - There is a synchronized [audiodescription](#audiodescription-synchronized-media-temporal).
  - There is an alternative version with a synchronized [audiodescription](#temporal-media-synchronized-audiodescription) accessible via an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button).

1. Find the synchronized temporal media (`<video>` or `<object>` elements) in the document that require a textual transcription.
2. For each synchronized temporal media, check the presence of:
   - either a textual transcription accessible by means of an adjacent link or button (a URL or an anchor);
   - either a clearly identifiable adjacent textual transcription;
   - either synchronized audio description;
   - either an alternative version with a synchronized audio description accessible by means of a button or an adjacent link (a URL or an anchor);
3. If this is the case for each temporal media, **the test is validated**.
