title: Does each pre-recorded audio-only [time-based media](#temporal-media-type-sound-video-and-synchronize) verify, if necessary, one of these conditions (except in particular cases)?
steps:
  - There is a [text transcript](#temporal-media-textual-transcription) accessible via an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button).
  - There is a clearly identifiable adjacent [text transcript](#temporal-media-textual-transcription).
---

1. Find in the document the time-based media (elements `<audio>`, `<video>` or `<object>`) only audio which require a text transcript.
2. For each audio-only time-based media, check for the presence of a text transcript:
   - is accessible by means of a button or an adjacent link (a URL or an anchor);
   - is clearly identifiable adjacent.
3. If this is the case for each time-based media, **the test is validated**.
