title: Does each pre-recorded audio-only [temporal media](#temporal-media-type-sound-video-and-synchronize) verify, if necessary, one of these conditions (except in special cases)?
steps:
  - There is a [textual transcription](#temporal-media-textual-transcription) accessible via an [adjacent link or button](#adjacent-link-or-button).
  - There is a clearly identifiable adjacent [textual transcription](#temporal-media-textual-transcription).

1. Find in the document the temporal media (elements `<audio>`, `<video>` or `<object>`) only audio which require a textual transcription.
2. For each audio-only temporal media, check for the presence of a textual transcription:
   - is accessible by means of a button or an adjacent link (a URL or an anchor);
   - is clearly identifiable adjacent.
3. If this is the case for each temporal media, **the test is validated**.
