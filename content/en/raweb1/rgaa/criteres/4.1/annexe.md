#### Special cases

There is special case management when:

- The [temporal media](#temporal-media-type-sound-video-and-synchronize) is used for decorative purposes (i.e. it does not provide any information);
- The [temporal media](#media-temporal-type-son-video-et-synchronise) is itself an alternative to the content of the page (a video in sign language or the vocalization of a text, for example example) ;
- The [temporal media](#temporal-media-type-sound-video-and-synchronize) is used to access an enlarged version;
- The [temporal media](#temporal-media-type-sound-video-and-synchronize) is used as a [CAPTCHA](#captcha);
- The [temporal media](#media-temporal-type-son-video-et-synchronise) is part of a test which would become useless if the [textual transcription](#transcription-textual-media-temporal), the [ synchronized subtitles](#synchronized-subtitles-multimedia-object) or [audio description](#synchronized-media-temporal audiodescription) were communicated;
- The temporal media was published before September 23, 2020 (according to the [law of May 28, 2019](http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2019/05/28/a373 /jo)).

In these situations, the criterion is not applicable.

This special case also applies to criteria 4.2, 4.3, 4.5.
