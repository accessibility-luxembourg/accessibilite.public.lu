title: Does each [editing tool](#edition-tool) that creates content in web format (HTML, CSS) allow you to define the necessary [accessibility information](#accessibility-information) to create [RAWeb](../raweb1/index.html) compliant content?
---
1. Locate in the tool the editing functionalities (for example, a text editor, but this can be a media library or any other interface which allows you to enter text or define properties) which allow you to create content in the format web (HTML, CSS).
2. Verify that it is possible to define the accessibility information necessary to make the content compliant with [RAWeb](../raweb1/index.html). For example :
- define the text alternative of an image from the text editor or a media library;
- define a link title;
- etc.
3. If so, the test is validated.
