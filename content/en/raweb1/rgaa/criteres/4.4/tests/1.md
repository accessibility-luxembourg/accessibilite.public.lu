title: For each pre-recorded synchronized [time-based media](#temporal-media-type-sound-video-and-synchronize) having [synchronized subtitles](#subtitles-synchronizes-multimedia-object), a subtitle track at least meets these conditions?
steps:
- Subtitles are in the language of the video;
- Subtitles are relevant;
- Subtitles are correctly synchronized.
---

1. Find the synchronized time-based media with synchronized subtitles in the document.
2. For each synchronized time-based media, verify that the subtitles are:
- in the language of the video (if the spoken content is in English, the subtitles must be in English);
- relevant (all the important sound information is present, particularly the dialogues);
- correctly synchronized. If you do not notice a delay between spoken speech and the appearance of subtitles, the subtitles are correctly synchronized. The reference standard specifies that captions should appear within 100ms of the [caption timestamp](#timestamp-time-stamp).
3. If this is the case for each synchronized time media, **the test is validated**.
