title: For each [complex data table](#complex-data-table), is a [summary](#table-summary) available?
---

1. Find complex data tables in the document (data table - element `<table>` or element with a WAI-ARIA attribute `role="table"` - containing headers which are not distributed only on the first row and/or the first column of the grid or whose scope is not valid for the entire column or row).
2. For each complex data table, check that a passage of text allowing the nature and structure of the table to be understood is present:
   - either in the `<caption>` element;
   - either in the `summary` attribute of the `<table>` element (in versions of HTML and XHTML prior to HTML 5);
   - either in a passage of text linked to the table with the `aria-describedby` attribute.
3. If this is the case for each complex data table, **the test is validated**.
