title: Does each [form field](#form-input-field) whose subject relates to information about the user satisfy these conditions?
steps:
  - The [form field](#form-input-field) has an `autocomplete` attribute;
  - The `autocomplete` attribute has a value present in the [list of possible values for the `autocomplete` attribute](#list-of-possible-values-for-the-autocomplete-attribute) associated with a [form field](#form-input-field).
  - The value indicated for the `autocomplete` attribute is relevant to the type of information expected.

1. Find the form fields in the document that relate to information concerning the user (last name, first name, telephone number, etc.).
2. For each form field, verify that:
   - The form field has an `autocomplete` attribute.
   - The `autocomplete` attribute has a value present in the <a rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank" title="list of possible values - in English - new window" href="https:// www.w3.org/TR/html52/sec-forms.html#autofill-processing-model">list of possible values</a>.
   - The value indicated for the `autocomplete` attribute is relevant to the type of information expected.
3. If this is the case for each form field found, **the test is validated**.
