title: In every web page, every auto-triggered moving content, does it satisfy any of these conditions?
steps:
  - The duration of the movement is less than or equal to 5 seconds.
  - The user can stop and restart the movement.
  - User can show and hide moving content.
  - The user can display all the information without movement.
---

1. Find moving content in the document (obtained using an image, a script or a CSS effect) automatically triggered when the page is loaded or when content is displayed (see note).
2. For each content, check that:
   - either the duration of the movement is less than 5 seconds;
   - either the presence of a mechanism (a button, for example) makes it possible to stop and restart the movement;
   - either the presence of a mechanism (a button, for example) makes it possible to hide and redisplay the moving content;
   - either the presence of a mechanism (a button, for example) makes it possible to display the entire content without movement.
3. If this is the case for each moving content, **the test is validated**.
