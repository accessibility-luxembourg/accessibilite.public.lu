title: On each web page, does each automatically triggered flashing content meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The flashing duration is less than or equal to 5 seconds.
  - The user can stop and restart the flashing.
  - The user can show and hide the flashing content.
  - The user can display all the information without the flashing.
---

1. Find flashing content in the document (obtained using an image, a script or a CSS effect) triggered automatically when the page is loaded or when content is displayed (see note).
2. For each content item, check that
   - either the flashing time is less than 5 seconds;
   - there is a mechanism (a button, for example) to stop and restart the flashing;
   - or the presence of a mechanism (a button, for example) means that the flashing content can be hidden and displayed again;
   - or a mechanism (such as a button) can be used to display all the flashing content.
3. If this is the case for each flashing content item, **the test is validated**.

Note: Stopping or pausing moving or flashing content by means of when focused (for example, the effect is only suspended when focused) is not considered a compliant process. In some cases, movement cannot be stopped, for example in the case of a progress bar, in which case the criterion is not applicable.
