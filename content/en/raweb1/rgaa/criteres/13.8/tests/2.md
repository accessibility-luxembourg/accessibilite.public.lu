title: In every web page, every automatically triggered flashing content, does it satisfy any of these conditions?
steps:
  - The flashing duration is less than or equal to 5 seconds.
  - The user can stop and restart the flashing.
  - User can show and hide flashing content.
  - The user can display the entire information without flashing.
---

1. Find flashing content in the document (obtained using an image, a script or a CSS effect) triggered automatically when the page is loaded or when content is displayed (see note ).
2. For each content, check that:
   - either the duration of the flashing is less than 5 seconds;
   - either the presence of a mechanism (a button, for example) makes it possible to stop and restart the flashing;
   - either the presence of a mechanism (a button, for example) makes it possible to hide and display the flashing content again;
   - either the presence of a mechanism (a button, for example) makes it possible to display all of the flashing content.
3. If this is the case for each flashing content, **the test is validated**.

Note: Stopping or pausing moving or flashing content by focusing (e.g. the effect is only paused while focusing) is not considered a compliant process . In some cases, the movement cannot be stopped, for example in the case of a progress bar, in this case the criterion is not applicable.
