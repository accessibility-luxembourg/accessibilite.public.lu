title: For each [bidirectional oral communication web application](#bidirectional-oral-communication-web-application), is the application capable of encoding and decoding this communication with a range of frequencies whose limit higher is at least 7000 Hz?
---

1. Activate the web application and launch a call between the two terminals.
2. Check that the quality of the oral activity with the web application is at least equivalent to the quality of the oral activity during a call with a landline telephone.
3. If the test is not satisfactory (for example, poor understanding of certain words spoken by the interlocutor, presence of extraneous noise, etc.), check the application documentation:
   1. the presence of a reference to the implementation of [ITU-T recommendation G.722](https://www.itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.722/fr);
   2. or the presence of a reference to the use of the [WebRTC API opus codec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/Formats/WebRTC_codecs);
   3. or the presence of a reference to the use of encoding and decoding whose frequency is greater than or equal to 7000 Hz.
4. Otherwise, it is recommended to ask the application publisher to provide these technical details, in particular by asking if the web application implements for example [ITU-T recommendation G.722](https://www .itu.int/rec/T-REC-G.722/fr) or uses the [WebRTC API opus codec](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Media/ Formats/WebRTC_codecs).
5. If so, the test is validated.
