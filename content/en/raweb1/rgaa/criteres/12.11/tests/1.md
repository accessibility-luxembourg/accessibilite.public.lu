1. Find in the document all the additional content appearing when hovering, when focusing or activating an interface component
2. For each additional content, if it contains interface components with which the user can interact with the keyboard (for example, a personalized tooltip which offers a link in its content), check that these interface components are reachable keyboard
3. If this is the case for each additional content, **the test is validated**.
