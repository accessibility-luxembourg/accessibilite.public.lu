title: In each web page, does each [keyboard shortcut](#keyboardshortcut) using only one key (lowercase or uppercase letter, punctuation, number or symbol) satisfy one of these conditions?
steps:
  - A mechanism is available to disable the [keyboard shortcut](#keyboardshortcut).
  - A mechanism is available to configure the [hotkey](#hotkey) key using modifier keys (<kbd>Ctrl</kbd>, <kbd>Alt</kbd>, <kbd>Shift< /kbd>, etc.).
  - In the case of a user [interface component](#interface-component), the [keyboard shortcut](#keyboardshortcut) associated with it can only be activated if the keyboard focus is on this component.

1. Find in the document all the keyboard shortcuts offered to the user
2. For each keyboard shortcut, verify that:
   - either a mechanism is available to disable the keyboard shortcut;
   - either a mechanism is available to configure the keyboard shortcut key using the modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift, etc.);
   - or, in the case of a user interface component, the keyboard shortcut associated with it can only be activated if the keyboard focus is on this component.
3. If this is the case for each keyboard shortcut, **the test is validated**.
