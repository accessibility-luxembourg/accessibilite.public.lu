Note: for criteria 13.1, 13.3 and 13.5, the methodologies have been revised to include the evaluation of content intended for publication in a mobile application. Although the corresponding criteria of the EN 301 549 standard (11.8.2 *Accessible content creation*{lang="en"} and 11.8.3 *Preservation of accessibility information in transformations*{lang="en"}) only target sections 9 (*Web content*{lang="en"}) and 10 (*Non-web content*{lang="en"}), and not section 11 (*Software*{lang="en"}, dedicated to the mobile context), it seemed essential to still include the evaluation of the elements targeted by these criteria if they appeared in a mobile application.

#### Theme 14 “Support services”

- [Criterion 14.1](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-14-1): revision of the wording of the criterion to better reflect what is evaluated.
- [Criterion 14.2](./referentiel-technique.html#crit-14-2): improvement of the methodology.
