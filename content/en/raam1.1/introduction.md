*Version 1.1, published on 24 February 2025*

According to the [law of 28 May 2019](http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2019/05/28/a373/jo), all websites and mobile applications of Luxembourg public sector bodies must be accessible. The [Information and Press Service](https://sip.gouvernement.lu/en.html) is responsible for monitoring their compliance with accessibility requirements. Furthermore, the [law of 8 March 2023](https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2023/03/08/a133/jo) extends this obligation to certain types of products and services. Monitoring their accessibility is the responsibility of the [OSAPS](https://accessibilite-produits-services.public.lu/en.html).

In this context, the framework for assessing the accessibility of mobile applications has been drawn up to serve as a basis for assessment and implementation for all public sector bodies in the scope of the law.

The RAAM provides an operational framework for checking compliance with accessibility requirements. It can therefore be used to check that a mobile application complies with the criteria described in the European standard [EN 301 549 v.3.2.1](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf) for the following sections: 

- 5 *Generic requirements*
- 6 *ICT with two-way voice communication*
- 7 *ICT with video capabilities*
- 10 *Non-web documents*
- 11 *Software*
- 12 *Documentation and support services*

It includes 108 control criteria.
