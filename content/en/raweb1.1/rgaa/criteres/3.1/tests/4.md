title: For each [CSS property defining a colour](#css-property-defining-a-colour) and [conveying information](#image-conveying-information-provided-by-colour), the [information](#information-provided-by-colour) must not be given solely by the colour. Is this rule respected?

1. Find the information provided by the colour in a CSS property in the document.
2. For each of these pieces of information, check for the presence of:
   - additional information in the code (`title`, `aria-label`, visually hidden text, `aria-current`, etc.);
   - and additional visual information to complement the colour (icon, graphic effect in terms of shape or position, typographical effect, etc.).
3. If this is the case for each piece of information, **the test is validated**.
