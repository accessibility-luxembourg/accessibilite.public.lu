title: Does each bitmap image with an [image caption](#image-caption) (`<canvas>` tag associated with an adjacent [image caption](#image-caption)), if necessary, meet these conditions?
steps:
  - The bitmap image (`<canvas>` tag) and its adjacent [image caption](#image-caption) are contained in a `<figure>` tag.
  - The [image caption](#image-caption) is contained in a `<figcaption>` tag.
---

1. Find in the document the bitmap images (`<canvas>` element).
2. For each image, check that
   - the image and its legend are contained in a `<figure>` tag;
   - the legend is contained in a `<figcaption>` tag.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
