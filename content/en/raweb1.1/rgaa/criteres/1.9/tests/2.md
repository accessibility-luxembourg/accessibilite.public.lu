title: Does each [object image](#object-image) with an [image caption](#image-caption) (`<object>` tag with the `type="image/..."` attribute associated with an adjacent [image caption](#image-caption)), if necessary, meet these conditions?
steps:
  - The [object image](#object-image) and its adjacent [image caption](#image-caption) are contained in a `<figure>` tag.
  - The [image caption](#image-caption) is contained in a `<figcaption>` tag.
---

1. Find in the document the object images with a legend (`<object>` element with the `type="image/..."` attribute).
2. For each image, check that
   - the image and its legend are contained in a `<figure>` tag;
   - the legend is contained in a `<figcaption>` tag.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
