title: Do the [indications of mandatory or optional field entries](#indication-of-mandatory-or-optional-fields) meet one of these conditions (excluding special cases)?
steps:
  - A [mandatory field indication](#indication-of-mandatory-or-optional-fields) is visible and allows the relevant field to be identified by name before entering data.
  - The mandatory field has the `aria-required="true"` or `required` attribute before entering data.
  - An [optional field indication](#indication-of-mandatory-or-optional-fields) is visible and allows the relevant field to be identified by name before entering data.

1. Find the mandatory form fields in the document.
2. For each form field, check that before data is entered:
   - either a mandatory field indication is visible and allows the field in question to be identified by name;
   - or a mandatory field indication is given by the presence of the `aria-required="true"` or `required` attribute on the field before data is entered;
   - or an optional field indication is visible and allows the field in question to be identified by name.
3. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.
