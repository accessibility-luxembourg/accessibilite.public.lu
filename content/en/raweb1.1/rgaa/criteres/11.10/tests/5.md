title: Do the instructions and indications of mandatory data type and/or format meet any of these conditions?
steps:
  - An instruction or indication of mandatory data type and/or format is visible and enables the relevant field to be identified by name before entering data.
  - An instruction or indication of mandatory data type and/or format is visible in the label or [passage of text](#passage-of-text-linked-by-aria-labelledby-or-aria-describedby) associated with the field before entering data.

1. Fill in the form fields with values that are likely to cause input errors (e.g. enter an invalid email address).
2. Validate the form.
3. For each form field that has a format check, verify that the instruction or indication of the required data type and/or format:
   - is indicated before input;
   - is clearly visible;
   - allows the relevant field to be identified by name or is included in the label or passage of text associated with the field.
4. If this is the case for each form field associated with an instruction or indication of the mandatory data type and/or format, **the test is validated**.
