title: On each web page, do the [document structure](#document-structure) meet these conditions?
steps:
  - The [document structure](#document-structure) uses a single visible element with the computed role of `main`.
  - The [document structure](#document-structure) uses a single visible element with the computed role of `banner`.
  - The [document structure](#document-structure) uses a single visible element with the computed role of `contentinfo`.
  - Elements that have a computed role of `navigation` are reserved for structuring primary and secondary navigation regions.

1. Check that elements with a computed role of `navigation` are not used to structure regions that have a function other than primary or secondary navigation.
2. If the document has multiple elements with a computed role of `main`, ensure that only one of these elements is visible (the other occurrences are provided with a `hidden` attribute, for example).
3. If the document has multiple elements with a computed role of `banner`, ensure that only one of these elements is visible (the other occurrences are provided with a `hidden` attribute, for example).
4. If the document has multiple elements with a computed role of `contentinfo`, ensure that only one of these elements is visible (the other occurrences are provided with a `hidden` attribute, for example).
5. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.
