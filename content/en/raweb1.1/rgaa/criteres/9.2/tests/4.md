title: The `<footer>` element, without the WAI-ARIA `role` attribute, used to structure the [footer region of the page](#footer-region), is nested within an element with a calculated role other than `article`, `complementary`, `main`, `navigation`, and `section`. Is this rule respected?

1. Check that the `<footer>` element, without the WAI-ARIA `role` attribute, used to structure the footer region of the page, is nested within an element with a calculated role other than:
  - `article`
  - `complementary`
  - `main`
  - `navigation`
  - `section`
2. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.
