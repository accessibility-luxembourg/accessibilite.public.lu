title: On each web page, do the key regions of the page that make up the [document structure](#document-structure) meet these conditions?
steps:
  - The element containing the page [header region](#header-region) has a [calculated role](#calculated-role) of `banner`.
  - The elements containing the [primary and secondary navigation regions](#menu-and-navigation-bar) have a [calculated role](#calculated-role)  of `navigation`.
  - The element containing the [search engine region](#search-engine-internal-to-a-website) has a [calculated role](#calculated-role)  of `search`.
  - The element containing the [main content region](#main-content-region) has a [calculated role](#calculated-role)  of `main`.
  - The element containing the [footer region](#footer-region) has a [calculated role](#calculated-role)  of `contentinfo`.

1. Check that the header region is structured using a `<header>` element or that it has a WAI-ARIA `role="banner"` attribute.
2. Check that the main and secondary navigation areas are implemented using a `<nav>` element or that they have a WAI-ARIA `role="navigation"` attribute.
3. Check that the search engine region is structured using a `<search>` element or that it has a WAI-ARIA `role="search"` attribute.
4. Check that the main content region is structured using a `<main>` element or that it has a WAI-ARIA `role="main"` attribute.
5. Check that the footer region is structured using a `<footer>` element or that it has a WAI-ARIA `role="contentinfo"` attribute.
6. If this is the case for each content region, **the test is validated**.
