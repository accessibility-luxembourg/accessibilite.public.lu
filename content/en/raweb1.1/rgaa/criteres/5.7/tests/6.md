title: For each `<th>` tag content that applies to a group of columns or rows and has a scope attribute, does the `<th>` tag meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The `<th>` tag has a `scope` attribute with the value `rowgroup` for [groups of row headers](#column-or-row-header).
  - The `<th>` tag has a `scope` attribute with the value `colgroup` for [groups of column headers](#column-or-row-header).

1. Find the data tables in the document.
2. For each header (`<th>` element) applying to a group of rows or a group of columns and provided with a `scope` attribute, check that the `scope` attribute has
   - either a `rowgroup` value for row header groups;
   - or a `colgroup` value for column header groups.
3. If this is the case for each header applying to a row group or column group and provided with a `scope` attribute, **the test is validated**.
