title: On each web page, is the [visible content](#visible-content) conveying information accessible to assistive technologies?

1. Identify the elements conveying information that may not be accessible to assistive technologies, for example, background images inserted by CSS.
2. Check that there is on the page an alternative that is accessible to assistive technologies (for example, visually hidden text that provides the same information).
3. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.
