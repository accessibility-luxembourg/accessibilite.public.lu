title: Does each [editing tool](#editing-tool) that creates content distributed in a mobile application allow you to define the [accessibility information](#accessibility-information) needed to create content that complies with the [RAAM](../raam1.1/index.html)?
---
1. Identify the editing functions in the tool (for example, a text editor, but it could also be a media library or any other interface making it possible to enter text or define properties) that allow you to create content for distribution in a mobile application.
2. Check that it is possible to define the accessibility information needed to make the content compliant with [RAAM](../raweb1.1/index.html) criteria. For example 
	- defining the text alternative for an image from the text editor or a media library;
	- defining the accessible name of a link;
	- etc.
3. If this is the case, the test is validated.
