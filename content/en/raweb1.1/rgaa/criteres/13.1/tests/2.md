title: For each web page, is every [redirect](#redirect) procedure carried out using a `<meta>` tag immediate (excluding special cases)?
---

1. In the document, find an automatic redirect initiated by a `<meta http-equiv="refresh" />` element.
2. If a redirection process exists, check:
   - either that the redirection is immediate (the `content` property must have the value 0, for example `content="0; URL='https://url.com'"`)
   - or that the time limit before redirection is at least twenty hours (the `content` property then has a value greater than or equal to 72000, for example `content="80000; URL='https://url.com'"`).
3. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.
