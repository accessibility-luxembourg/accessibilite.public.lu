title: Do the content grouping zones present on several web pages (with the exception of the main regions composing the document structure) meet at least one of these conditions, if necessary?
steps:
  - The zone has a WAI-ARIA role of type [landmark](#landmarks) corresponding to its nature.
  - The zone has a heading whose content makes it possible to understand the nature of the zone's content.
  - The zone can be hidden by means of a button directly preceding the zone in the order of the source code.
  - The zone can be avoided by means of a [skip link](#bypass-or-skip-links) directly preceding the zone in the order of the source code.
  - The zone can be reached by means of a [bypass link](#bypass-or-skip-links) visible or, failing that, visible when focused.

1. Find in the document the content grouping zones (with the exception of the main regions composing the document structure).
2. For each zone, check that the zone
   - either has a WAI-ARIA landmark role corresponding to its nature;
   - or has a heading whose content makes it possible to understand the nature of the zone content;
   - or can be hidden by means of a button directly preceding the zone in the order of the source code;
   - or can be avoided by means of a skip link directly preceding the zone in the order of the source code;
   - or can be reached using a bypass link, either visible by default, or visible when focused during tabbing.
3. If this is the case for each content grouping zone, **the test is validated**.
