title: Do the content grouping blocks present on several web pages (with the exception of the main regions composing the document structure) meet at least one of these conditions, if necessary?
steps:
  - The block has a WAI-ARIA role of type [landmark](#landmarks) corresponding to its nature.
  - The block has a heading whose content makes it possible to understand the nature of the block's content.
  - The block can be hidden by means of a button directly preceding the block in the order of the source code.
  - The block can be avoided by means of a [skip link](#bypass-or-skip-links) directly preceding the block in the order of the source code.
  - The block can be reached by means of a [bypass link](#bypass-or-skip-links) visible or, failing that, visible when focused.

1. Find in the document the content grouping blocks (with the exception of the main regions composing the document structure).
2. For each block, check that the block
   - either has a WAI-ARIA landmark role corresponding to its nature;
   - or has a heading whose content makes it possible to understand the nature of the block content;
   - or can be hidden by means of a button directly preceding the block in the order of the source code;
   - or can be avoided by means of a skip link directly preceding the block in the order of the source code;
   - or can be reached using a bypass link, either visible by default, or visible when focused during tabbing.
3. If this is the case for each content grouping block, **the test is validated**.
