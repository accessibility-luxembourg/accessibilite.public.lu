title: On each web page, does each [cryptic content](#cryptic-content) conveying information meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The meaning of the content is provided in the adjacent context.
  - The meaning of the content is provided by a method that is [compatible with accessibility](#compatible-with-assistive-technologies).
---

1. Find in the document the cryptic content conveying information.
2. For each cryptic content, check that
   - Either its meaning is given in the adjacent context (immediately before or after).
   - Or its meaning is made available by a method compatible with accessibility, for example, the cryptic content is included in a link whose accessible name is defined by the `aria-label` property, which contains the meaning of the cryptic content.
3. If this is the case for each cryptic content, **the test is validated**.
