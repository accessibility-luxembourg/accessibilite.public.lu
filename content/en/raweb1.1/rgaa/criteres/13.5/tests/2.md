title: On each web page, is each [cryptic content](#cryptic-content) correctly ignored by assistive technologies using a WAI-ARIA `aria-hidden="true"` attribute?

1. Find in the document the cryptic content.
2. For each cryptic content, check that
   - Either the cryptic content is embedded in a tag that has a WAI-ARIA `aria-hidden="true"` attribute.
   - Or a parent tag of the cryptic content has a WAI-ARIA `aria-hidden="true"` attribute.
3. If this is the case for each cryptic content, **the test is validated**.
