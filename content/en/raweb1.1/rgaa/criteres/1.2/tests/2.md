title: Does each [non-clickable](#non-clickable-area) [decoration area](#decorative-image) (`<area>` tag without `href` attribute), meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The `<area>` tag has an empty `alt` attribute (`alt=""`) and no other attribute to provide a [text alternative](#text-alternative-image).
  - The `<area>` tag has a WAI-ARIA `aria-hidden="true"`.
  - The `<area>` tag has a `role="presentation"` or `role="none"` and does not have a `title` attribute.
  - The `<area>` tag has a `role="presentation"` or `role="none"` and does not have a WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute.
  - The `<area>` tag has a `role="presentation"` or `role="none"` and does not have the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute.

1. Find in the document the decorative images implemented using an `<area>` element (without a `href` attribute).
2. For each image, check that the `<area>` element has an `aria-hidden="true"` attribute.
3. If not, check that the `<area>` element has a `role="presentation"` or `role="none"` attribute and that it does not have `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label`, or `title` attributes.
4. If not, check that the `<area>` element has an empty `alt` attribute (`alt=""`) and that it does not have `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label`, or `title` attributes.
5. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
