title: Each [decorative](#decorative-image) vector image (`<svg>` tag), without [image caption](#image-caption), has a WAI-ARIA `aria-hidden="true"` attribute. Is this rule respected?
---

1. Find in the document the decorative images without an image caption, implemented using a `<svg>` element.
2. For each image, check that the `<svg>` element has a WAI-ARIA `aria-hidden="true"` attribute.
3. If this is the case for each image, **the test is validated**.
