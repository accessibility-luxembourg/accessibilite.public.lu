title: Does each [decorative image](#decorative-image) (`<img>` tag), without [image caption](#image-caption), meet one of these conditions?
steps:
  - The `<img>` tag has an empty `alt` attribute (`alt=""`) and no other attribute to provide a [text alternative](#text-alternative-image).
  - The `<img>` tag has a WAI-ARIA `aria-hidden="true"` attribute.
  - The `<img>` tag has a `role="presentation"` or `role="none"` and does not have a `title` attribute.
  - The `<img>` tag has a `role="presentation"` or `role="none"` and does not have a WAI-ARIA `aria-labelledby` attribute.
  - The `<img>` tag has a `role="presentation"` or `role="none"` and does not have the WAI-ARIA `aria-label` attribute.

1. Find in the document the decorative images without a legend implemented using an `<img>` element.
2. For each image, check that it has an `aria-hidden="true"` attribute.
3. If not, check that the image has a `role="presentation"` or `role="none"` attribute and that it does not have `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label`, or `title` attributes.
4. If not, check that the image has an empty `alt` attribute (`alt=""`) and that it does not have `aria-labelledby`, `aria-label`, or `title` attributes.
5. If this is the case, **the test is validated**.
