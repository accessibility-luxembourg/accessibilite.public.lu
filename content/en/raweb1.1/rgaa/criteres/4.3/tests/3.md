title: Does each live synchronised [time-based media](#time-based-media-audio-video-and-synchronised) have synchronised [captions](#synchronised-captions-media-object) where necessary (except in special cases)?

1. Find the live synchronised time-based media in the document.
2. For each synchronised time-based media, check for the presence of
   - either captions;
   - or an alternative version with captions accessible via a link or adjacent button.
3. If this is the case for each live synchronised time-based media, **the test is validated**.
