title: Link whose nature is not obvious
---

A link which can be confused with normal text when it is indicated by colour alone by certain types of user who have little or no perception of colour. For example, in this text "New summer timetable", if the word "timetable" is a link indicated by colour only, its nature may be ignored by users who cannot perceive colour and are accessing the content with CSS enabled.

Note: "indicated only by colour" means that the link is not accompanied by any visual marker (icon, underline, border, etc.). Consequently, a link of the same colour as the surrounding text is affected by this criterion.
