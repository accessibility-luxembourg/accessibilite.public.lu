title: Indication of data type and/or format
---

Text indication enabling the user to know what type of data and/or input format is required.

Examples

- Email (format: you@domain.com);
- Postcode (format: 00000);
- Date (format: DD/MM/YYYY).
- Amount in euros.

Important note: when the type of form input field offers an input mask, for example the `date` or `time` fields, the format indication is not necessary.
