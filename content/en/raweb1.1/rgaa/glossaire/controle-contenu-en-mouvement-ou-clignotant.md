title: Control (moving or blinking content)
---

The ability for the user to control the display or playback of moving or blinking content using at least the keyboard and mouse.

The method used to control moving or blinking content must allow the user to interact with the rest of the page.

Therefore, the fact that the animation stops when the user moves the mouse pointer or the keyboard focus to the underlying component (and resumes as soon as the user moves the mouse pointer or the keyboard focus elsewhere on the page) would not be considered a ‘mechanism for controlling moving or flashing content’, as the page would become unusable during that time.

Consequently, stopping or pausing via an event triggered only on focus or mouseover does not satisfy the criterion.

All moving content, with the exception of time-based media supported by the multimedia theme, is covered: animated images (e.g. an animated gif), moving content offered via an `<object>` tag, JavaScript code or CSS effects, for example.

Note 1: where appropriate, the control method should be available as the first element of the page.
