title: Identical link
---

Two links are said to be identical when the [accessible name](#accessible-name-of-a-link) of link x is equal to link y. This definition applies to all types of links: text links, image links (where the links have the same image) and composite links.

Please note: links with identical accessible names but different [contexts](#link-context) are not identical (example: `<p>To register for the course on 12/10/2025 <a href="link_bar.html">download the form</a></p>` and `<p>To register for the course on 18/10/2025 <a href="link_doc.html">download the form</a></p>`)
