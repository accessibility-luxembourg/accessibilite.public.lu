title: Document
---

File, set of files, streaming media or any other distinct content that does not constitute a collection of items, does not belong to a software and does not embed its own user agent.

Emails, spreadsheets, books, images and movies are examples of documents.

A document may consist of several files: a set of files comprising the video, audio and subtitle files of a movie is an example of a document.

A set of files compressed into an archive does not constitute a single document when grouped together in this way, but rather a collection of documents. 

Anything that can present its own content without involving a user agent, such as a book that reads itself, is not a document, but software.
