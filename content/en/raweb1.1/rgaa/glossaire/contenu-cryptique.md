title: Cryptic content
---

Content written using misused characters. For example, emoticons, figures written with characters, symbol characters or text written with mathematical characters are considered cryptic content. Cryptic syntax refers to words or phrases that use characters or case effects inappropriately (<em lang="en">leetspeak</em>) or that divert characters from their usual uses, such as the use of capital letters, numbers or special characters in the body of a word.

Some examples:
* emoticons: :) (smile), ^^ (smile with squinted eyes), O_o (surprised);
* cryptic syntax: m4gic (magic);
* mathematical characters resembling letters: 𝒉𝒆𝒍𝒍𝒐 (hello);
* emojis: <span aria-hidden="true">♥</span> (heart emoji).

Note 1: Some emojis are rendered by screen readers that have their own alternatives. An emoji will be considered compliant, without additional implementation, when the alternative rendered across the entire baseline is relevant to the context.

Note 2: Hashtags (‘#Employment’) and URLs (https://www.site.sample.com) are not considered cryptic content.
