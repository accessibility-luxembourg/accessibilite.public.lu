*Version 1.0, released April 5, 2023*

According to the [Luxembourg law of May 28, 2019](http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2019/05/28/a373/jo), all websites and mobile applications of Luxembourg public sector organizations must be accessible. The [Information and Press Service](https://sip.gouvernement.lu/) is responsible for controlling their accessibility.

In this context, the PDF framework was developed to serve as a basis for evaluation and implementation for all public sector organizations affected by the law.

This framework provides an operational framework for verifying compliance with accessibility requirements. Therefore, it makes it possible to verify that a PDF document complies with the criteria described in the European standard [EN 301 549 v.3.2.1](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/ 03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf) for Section 10 Non-web documents.

It includes 46 control criteria.

If the repository has not been updated within 3 years to take into account new standards or technical specifications, it is possible to create your own tests in addition to existing ones.
