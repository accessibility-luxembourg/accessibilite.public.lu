### A

#### Absent from the restitution (decorative image)

The image is declared “decorative” (e.g. in Microsoft Office) or “artifact” (Acrobat Pro), so that it is not part of the content made available for restitution.

#### Activation duration

Activation duration of flashing or moving content: duration during which flashing or movement is active.

#### Adjacent colors
Color directly in contact with the colors of the graphic element, such as the background color or any other color in direct contact.

Example: in a “no entry” sign, the red of the sign is the color adjacent to the white line in the center of the sign.

It is important to understand that [criterion 2.3](referentiel-technique.md#crit-2-3) on the contrasts of graphic elements only evaluates non-textual elements. When it comes to evaluating the contrast of a text, even if it is present in a graphic element, it is [criterion 2.2](referentiel-technique.md#crit-2-2) which applies.

Not all colors of a graphic element must be evaluated. Only colors carrying information are concerned.

For example, in a pie chart, the contrast ratio between the adjacent colors of each sector and between each color and the background color must be evaluated if this is the only way to retrieve the information.

On the other hand, if a legend gives in text form the values and all the useful information for each sector, the criterion is no longer applicable, since the information is available by another means.

#### Alternative text version
This is text identical to the content of a text image. The alternative version may be made available via an anchor adjacent to the image or a link to view an alternative version of the document in which the text images are replaced by text.

### C

#### Complex data table
A complex data table is a table that contains more than one header row and/or column.

A complex data table cannot be rendered correctly when produced from office editing software.

It is necessary to provide an alternative in the form of structured text containing the same information.

#### Complex shape
These are contents such as diagrams or diagrams created by the drawing, diagram generation and diagram tools offered by office editing tools.

**Note about tools for automatic generation of complex shapes**: some office editing tools offer components for generating automatic diagrams.
These components should not be used, as their restitution is generally not satisfactory. One solution is to replace them with images.

#### Consistent labels
Form field labels present in the same document and which require the entry of the same information must be formulated unambiguously so that the user understands that the information they must communicate is the same.

#### Cryptic content
This is content written using diverted characters. For example, emoticons or figures written with characters are considered cryptic content. Cryptic syntax refers to words or phrases that use characters or capitalization inappropriately (leetspeak) or that divert characters from their usual uses such as capitalization, numbers or special characters in the body of a word. Finally, the use of unconventional abbreviations (e.g. slt for “hi”) is also considered cryptic content.

Some examples:
- emoticon: :), ^^, O_o;
- cryptic syntax: m4gic (magic), ama (in my opinion).

**Note**: “hashtags” (“#Job”) or URLs (https://www.site.sample.com) are not considered cryptic content.

### D

#### Data table
Content structure for displaying information in rows and columns using header cells and data cells.

#### Decorative
Complex image or shape that does not provide any information essential to understanding the content with which it is associated.

#### Detailed description
Content associated with an image or a complex shape, in addition to its alternative, which makes available all of the information contained in the image or complex shape.

The detailed description must be adjacent to the image or complex shape or viewable through an adjacent link.

#### Different states of a graphic element
Sometimes a graphic element is presented with different states. For example, a star-based voting system where the number of stars of a certain color represents the value of the rating assigned. It is important that the color ratio between the default color and the color of each state is sufficient.

#### Document title
Metadata allowing you to give a title to the document, generally entered in the document properties.

**Note**: The first title of the content or the cover title is not the title of the document.

### E

#### Explicit reference (to an image caption or complex shape)
Explicit indication (example: “See caption below”) or common term (e.g. “Image: [alternative]” and “Image: [caption]”) between the alternative and the caption which allows us to understand that the caption is associated with the image.

### H

#### Header (table)
Cell which serves as a heading for a column, a row, part of a column, part of a row or groupings of rows or columns (merged header).

### F

#### Flashing or moving content
This generally involves content produced using animated images (e.g. GIF format).

#### Form field
Interactive object allowing the user to enter data. Form fields include a wide variety of input types:

- free entry fields,
- check boxes or radio buttons,
- selection lists,
- specific fields like date entry fields, etc.

### I

#### Image text or text in image
Image displaying text.

#### Indication given only by shape, size or position
Any essential indication which is transmitted solely by a change in the shape or size of text content or by the position of an element in a text.

For example:

- Indicate in a list the obligatory nature of the elements by the use or positioning of a special character diverted from its use (for example, a mathematical character).
- Indicate a specific text or part of text in content by bolding or changing size.

Other forms of indication by shape, size or position can be used without it being possible to indicate it here.

#### Information carrier
Complex image or shape that contains at least one piece of information essential to understanding the content with which it is associated.

#### Information given only by color
Information conveyed visually through color. For example:
- In a list of documents, documents in red are mandatory.
- In a graph, the different data are only associated with a color legend.

The alternative means used depends on the nature of the content concerned. For example:
- The association of an explicit text.
- The association of a visual indication such as an icon or symbol.

Note: in the case of using an image associated with a text, the image must have a relevant alternative (criteria[1.1](referentiel-technique.md#crit-1-1) and[1.2](referentiel-technique.md#crit-1-2)).

#### Input control
Set of processes that warn the user:

- obligatory fields,
- indications of expected type or format,
- entry errors in a form.

### L

#### Label
Text associated with a form field allowing you to identify and understand the nature of the entry.

#### Legend
Text that contains information about the image or complex shape it is associated with. For example copyright information, date, author, location, technical characteristics, etc.

#### Linearized content
Order of restitution of presentation table contents when these contents are browsed cell by cell.

#### Link
A link can be of three different forms:
- text link whose title consists of text alone;
- image link whose title consists of the alternative of the image;
- composite link which combines text and an image, the title is then made up of the text and the alternative image.

#### Link context
This is additional information which can, via shortcuts or keyboard manipulation, be associated with the title of the link.

In an office environment, the usable contexts are:
- the previous title;
- the sentence or paragraph in which the link is present;

The link will be considered explicit when at least one of these contexts provides all the information to understand its function and destination.

#### Link title
The title of the link can consist of:
- link text for text links;
- the image alternative for image links;
- the association of the link text and the image alternative for composite links.

#### Link whose nature is not obvious
This is a link whose title does not allow us to understand its nature, which may lead visually impaired people to ignore it.

Example of a link whose nature is obvious: “The general conditions of use of our services have been updated, click to consult them online.”

If the text “Click to view them online” is a link, its nature is obvious.

Example of a link whose nature is not obvious: “The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 defines how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. »

If the text “Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1” is a link, its title is insufficient to understand its nature.

**Important note**: Only links that are inserted in text blocks are affected.

#### List style
In office content, lists must be declared using a list style.
For example, office editing software provides a style library reserved for unordered lists (bulleted list) and ordered lists (numbered list).
Using specific list styles allows the reading software to associate each list and its items with an ad hoc format.

### N

#### Non-interactive form

This is a document presenting form fields in the form of simple graphic areas, for example:

Your name: [............................]

This type of document, which actually simulates a form to be printed, cannot be used correctly by people with disabilities.

In this case, the document must be recreated in the form of an interactive form.

### P

#### Presentation board
Table that is used to display information using cells without this information requiring the presence of a row or column header.

### R

#### Replacement mechanism (enhanced contrast)
Method which allows the user to obtain a version of the document with sufficient contrasts.

The alternative version can be offered in the form of a document in office formats (DOCX, ODT, PDF) or HTML.

The alternative document must be viewable from the original PDF document in the form of a download link or allowing the page to be displayed in a browser when it is a document in HTML format.

#### Restitution order
In an office environment, the rendering order is dictated by the order in which the content is written.
However, certain bad practices can disrupt the order in which content is rendered.

For example:
- the use of tabs or spaces to create colon effects;
- the use of functionalities which allow the creation of freely positioned text boxes on the content.

Most office publishing software has features to manage columnaring, “docking” or choose a “skin” to link the content area to a text block.

If they are not used, this has the effect of making the restitution order inconsistent.

**Note about content box insertion tools**: depending on the anchor or wrapping style chosen, the text box will be positioned before or after the content block with which it is associated.

If the text box and the content block do not have a logical relationship, the criterion will be considered compliant regardless of the visual positioning of the text box and the content block.

Conversely, if the text area and the content block must be rendered in a particular order and the wrapping or anchoring does not respect this order, the criterion will be non-compliant.

Other restitution order issues may be found without it being possible to provide them here.

### S

#### Same links
Links whose titles, associated with the context of the link (previous title, sentence) are identical.

For example:
- In the next two sentences, the two “click here” links are not identical, because they benefit from a different context: “To consult our catalog: click here” and “To contact us: click here”.
- In the following sentence, the two links “on this page” are identical, because the context does not allow them to be differentiated: “You can contact us on this page or on this page.”

#### Side by side (label and field side by side)

The label and its field must be visually close so that the relationship between the two cannot cause confusion.

#### Structural elements
These are the formats and styles with which the content is structured (headings, lists, paragraphs, etc.).
When these formats or styles are used to create presentation effects, the rendering can be profoundly impacted. For example, using a heading style to format a paragraph, using paragraphs to create margin effects, etc.

**Note about the use of paragraphs**: the presence of an empty paragraph after structured content, for example a title, a list, a paragraph of text at the end of the page, is not considered as a non-compliance. Only the use of several successive empty paragraphs is concerned.

#### Summary
List of content titles, presented in the introduction to the document, generally in the form of links allowing direct access to the parts concerned. Each title may be accompanied by the corresponding page number.
Depending on the software used to edit the content, the summary can be structured with TOC and TOCI elements or L and LI elements.

### T

#### Tab order
Order in which contents are navigated with the tab key. This path can become inconsistent in certain situations, for example when clickable elements are inserted into complex shapes or text boxes and the latter are not presented in a consistent order.
Similarly, in a PDF form, the tab order of input fields and buttons can be inconsistent when positioned incorrectly.

#### Text alternative
Text associated with an image or a complex shape which provides information equivalent to that conveyed by the image or the complex shape.

**Note**: The text alternative is not necessarily text that describes the complex image or shape. Its aim is to transmit to people who cannot see the image or complex shape the essential information it provides in text form.

#### Text in normal size
Text and image text in normal size is less than 150% or 120% bold compared to the default size.

The default size is the body text size.

#### Text in enlarged size
Text and image text in enlarged size is greater than or equal to 150% or 120% bold of the default size.

#### Title style
In office content, titles must be declared using a title style.
For example, office editing software provides a style library reserved for titles.
Using specific paragraph styles allows the reading software to associate each heading with an ad hoc marked format.

#### Titration hierarchy
In most office editing software, the style library provides a particular style for each heading level, usually up to 8 levels.

The titration hierarchy is consistent when:
- All text passages intended to be a title use a title style.
- The first title of the content is level 1.
- There is no break in the titling hierarchy (for example we do not go directly from a level 2 title to a level 4 title).

### U

#### Untagged documents
These are documents in which structural elements (title, list, paragraph, etc.) are absent.

In this case, the document must be revised in depth or recreated completely.

The status of the tagging can be checked in the document properties: "file" menu, then "properties" submenu, then "tagged PDF" parameter, when the indication is "no" the document is not tagged.
