Some of the tests in the PDF accessibility assessment framework are carried out using a dedicated test tool and the assistive technologies made available on the platforms.

### Test environment

Although PDF documents can be used on the macOS platform, there is no tool for checking the accessibility of PDF documents.

The test platform chosen is <span class="en">Windows</span> version 10, at least.

The versions of assistive technologies to be used are the latest available on the operating system selected.

Some tests are carried out directly in [Acrobat Reader](https://get.adobe.com/fr/reader/?promoid=TTGWL47M){lang=en}.
