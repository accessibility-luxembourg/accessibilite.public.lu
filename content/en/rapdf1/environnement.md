Some of the tests in the PDF accessibility assessment framework are carried out using a dedicated test tool and the assistive technologies made available on the platforms.

### Testing environment

Although PDF documents can be used on the macOS platform, there is no tool for checking the accessibility of PDF documents.

The test platform chosen is <span class="en">Windows</span> version 10, at least.

The versions of assistive technologies to be used are the latest available on the operating system selected.

Some tests are carried out directly in [Acrobat Reader](https://get.adobe.com/reader/).

#### Test tools
##### Dedicated test tool

The dedicated test tool is [PAC 2024](https://pac.pdf-accessibility.org/en/download)

##### Screen reader used for testing

The screen reader used to carry out the rendition tests for the "Interactive form" theme is [NVDA](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/).

The [Methodology](methodologie.md) section of this framework contains resources to help you install and configure the various test tools.
