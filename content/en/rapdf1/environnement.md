A certain part of the testing of the benchmark for evaluating the accessibility of documents in PDF format is carried out with a dedicated testing tool and the assistive technologies made available on the platforms.

### Test Environment

Although PDF documents can be used on the macOS platform, there is no tool to check the accessibility of PDF documents.

The test platform chosen is the <span class="en">Windows</span> platform in version 10, at least.

The versions of the assistive technologies to be used are the latest available on the operating system selected.

Some tests are carried out directly in the software [Acrobat Reader](https://get.adobe.com/fr/reader/?promoid=TTGWL47M).
