<h2>2023&#8239;: the web is progressing, mobile apps are slipping</h2>
<h3>A few public websites achieved good performance, but on mobile the room for improvement remains significant</h3>
<hr>
<div class="intro">
    <p>Fifteen public websites were subject to a detailed accessibility audit in 2023. The trend is positive: the compliance rate stands on average around 54%, or six points gained by compared to 2022 (48%). It itself had gained four points since the very first audit campaign in 2020-2021.</p>
</div>
<p>This dynamic should not, however, make us forget that such an average remains too close to the threshold of partial compliance (from 50%) and that the objective set by the law is, purely and simply, compliance, 100%.</p>

</figure>
<p>The disparities observed last year are even more marked this year, with five very good students quite high in the ranking (public markets, logement.lu, public inquiry portal, labor and mining inspection and, finally, the new website of the Chamber of Deputies), all quite far ahead of the number one for the year 2022 (covid19.public.lu, 66%).</p>
<p>First lesson: at 89% compliance, full compliance is not an unattainable objective, even for rather rich and complex portals.</p>
<p>Second lesson: if the CTIE “truste” the first four places, revealing a certain know-how in terms of digital accessibility, other players were able to ensure it was respected, first and foremost the project team which oversaw the redesign of the chd.lu portal.</p >
<p>Less than half of the sample (7 sites) exceeds the 50% compliance rate mark, the level which separates non-compliance from partial compliance.</p>

        <p>This bar chart presents fifteen public sites targeted for full audits in 2023 in descending order of compliance with RGAA criteria, from the marches.public.lu site (89%) to the liser.lu site (27%).</ p>
    </details>
    <p>Below 50%, a site is not considered accessible. Or 8 out of 15 sites audited</p>
</figure>
<p>A compliance rate is here the summary of conformities and non-conformities identified through <a href="https://accessibilite.public.lu/fr/rgaa4.1.2/criteres.html"> 106 RGAA</a> criteria, themselves divided into thirteen themes. However, it is only a measurement and a high rate does not guarantee an accessible site. A web portal can benefit from a rate of more than 90%... if the remaining percent sanctions inaccessible navigation, all of the pages cannot be consulted by people with disabilities.</p>
<h4>At the top of the top 10 non-conformities: easily solvable problems...</h4>
<p>Which criteria were most often found wanting? In other words, what's wrong most with the audits carried out in 2023?</p>
<p>Style issues are numerous and, yet, relatively simple to improve: these are texts and interactive components (like buttons) that require better contrast, empty paragraphs than a dedicated style could replace by setting an adequate margin, a focus too little visible, or even invisible, when a user navigates using the tab key. In most cases, you just need to adjust the site's style sheet. From time to time, specific development, such as the provision of a <span lang="en">style switcher</span>, is required.</p>

        <p>This bar chart presents, among the 106 RGAA criteria, the ten most often cited in audits, carried out on fifteen public sites in 2023.</p>
    </details>
    <p>In the top three: elements that are easy to resolve</p>
</figure>
<p>Then come questions of structuring the information: do the titles correctly arrange the content of the page? Do titles and lists use canonical HTML tags? These elements, among others, allow assistive technologies to ensure optimal navigation of the page. The latter will render the content even better as each language change has been indicated by the developers... or the content editors.</p>
<p>This last clarification is important: in a certain number of cases (insufficient contrasts, abusive use of HTML tags for presentation purposes, absence of relevant titles, decorative images which are not ignored by readers of the 'screen), responsibility may lie with the development team or the editorial team... hence the need for <a href="https://function-publique.public.lu/en/formation- development/catalogue-training/secteur-etatique/04organisat/04-6-egalch/et_04-6-3-27.html">accessibility training</a> dedicated and adapted to all those involved in a web project.< /p>
<h4>... and other less basic elements</h4>
<p>The compatibility of scripts with assistive technologies is a specific issue for developers. These are often vital elements of interaction – a navigation menu for example – for which compliance with <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/" >ARIA design patterns</a> may require further development.</p>
<p>Office documents (PDF and Office documents) conclude this overview: not easy to make accessible, they can represent a barrier to information if there is no alternative, for example in the form of a page accessible web, is not planned. The year 2023 saw the arrival, on our portal, of a <a href="https://accessibilite.public.lu/en/rapdf1/referentiel-technique.html">reference specially designed for accessibility PDF</a>&#8239;: we invite you to consult it and (re)read <a href="https://accessibilite.public.lu/en/news/2023-04-28-des- pdf-majority-inaccessibles.html">our study on the accessibility of PDFs published on public sites</a>.</p>
<h4>Mobile apps: a problematic downfall</h4>
<p>It is impossible here to mention any progress when the compliance rate of apps audited last year was at 49%... compared to 43% in 2023. Six points lost... this raises questions, for a list of achievements where only two apps are compliant: Meteolux, with a more than honorable score of 66%, and vdl.lu (59%).</p>
<figure class="chart">
    <div id="full_app_compliance">
        <img src="../../../../content/en/news/img/2023-report/2023_full_app_compliance.svg" alt="Graph 3. Compliance rate of apps audited in 2023 (see description below).">
    </div>
    <details>
        <summary>Description of graph 3</summary>
        <p>This bar chart shows six public apps targeted for full audits in 2023 in descending order of compliance with RAAM criteria, from the Meteolux app on Android (66%) to the LLO app on iOS (26%). </p>
    </details>
    <p>Only two partially compliant apps in 2023: the situation deserves major work.</p>
</figure>
<p>In a world where apps are increasingly used on a massive scale, the effort to bring them into compliance must be crucial.</p>
<p>The repository dedicated to apps, the <a href="https://accessibilite.public.lu/en/raam1/referentiel-technique.html">RAAM</a>, shares 107 criteria into fifteen themes. Six criteria account for half of the non-conformities:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Two criteria integrated into the “Colors” theme, penalizing the insufficient contrast of texts and interface components;</li>
    <li>A criterion invalidating components incompatible with assistive technologies (for example a component which does not announce its nature or its name, buttons without titles, a menu which does not announce a change of state , “open” or “closed”);</li>
    <li>A criterion reporting the absence of appropriate titles to structure the information&#8239;;</li>
    <li>A criterion revealing the impossibility of doubling the size of the characters while keeping all the texts readable&#8239;;</li>
    <li>Finally, a criterion revealing an app that is incompatible in landscape mode.</li>
</ul>
<p>Other criteria follow, including ensuring that decoration images are ignored by screen readers, that lists are correctly structured, that interface components can be controlled by the keyboard or any other pointing device or that the app's documentation is accessible and describes its accessibility features.</p>
<h4>The gap between municipalities and state sites remains</h4>
<p>In addition to full audits, the SIP carried out 93 <a href="https://accessibilite.public.lu/en/monitoring/controle-simplifie.html">simplified web audits</a>. The average score (56%, two points more compared to 2022) is close to that observed for complete web audits. Ten sites have a compliance rate greater than 80% - all in .public.lu, including infocrise.public.lu, the only site to present total compliance, according to the criteria examined. More than half of the sample (56 sites) exceeds the 50% compliance rate mark.</p>

        <p>This bar chart presents, in descending order, the compliance rates of the ten sites at the top of the ranking from the sample of 93 sites analyzed in 2023 as part of the simplified audits campaign, from infocrise.public .lu (100%) to justice.public.lu (81%).</p>
    </details>
    <p>93 sites benefited from a simplified audit in 2023. The first ten excel.</p>
</figure>
<p>At the bottom of the ranking are still mainly municipal sites. The gap between the latter and state sites remains significant. And if it tends to tighten by three points compared to 2022, it is due not to an improvement in the average of local sites (which remains at 47%) but to a slight drop in the average of state sites, who lose three points.</p>

        <p>This column diagram presents the average levels of compliance with RGAA criteria according to whether the site belongs to the State domain (64%), at the local level (municipalities, municipal unions, etc.: 47 %) or at another level (public establishments and similar organizations: 49%), among 93 public sites targeted for simplified audits in 2023.</p>
    </details>
    <p>From one year to the next, the average for municipalities stagnates and remains in the field of non-compliance</p>
</figure>
<h4>Fewer complaints... but all satisfied</h4>
<p>Eighteen in 2020-2021, nine last year, three as of December 19, 2023&#8239;: complaints that any citizen can send, in particular via <a href="https://sip.gouvernement.lu/en/support/reclamation-accessibility.html">the online complaint form</a> of the SIP, this year concerned exclusively accessibility problems linked to PDF files, on state sites. In all cases, a solution was quickly proposed.</p>
<h4>Progress set to increase</h4>
<p><a href="https://accessibilite.public.lu/en/news/2023-02-20-rapport2022.html">Compared to 2022</a>, the observation is rather positive&#8239; : despite a poor performance on the mobile apps side, the sites reveal palpable progress, but it is a mixed result if we note the room for progress that still exists... until conformity. 2025 is a year away: the private sector will also have to be exemplary in terms of digital accessibility, <a href="https://accessibilite.public.lu/en/news/2023 -02-27-european_accessibility_act.html">as required by the law passed in March 2023</a>. The public sector has one year to show its credentials. <a href="https://accessibilite.public.lu/en/news/2023-12-19-2024-2025-samples.html">Here are the sites and apps that will be subject to an audit over the next two years </a>.</p>
