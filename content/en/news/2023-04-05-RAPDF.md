<h2>A toolbox to ensure the accessibility of your PDFs</h2>
<h3>After the benchmarks dedicated to the evaluation of websites (RGAA) and mobile applications (RAAM), here is one dedicated to PDF format</h3>
<hr>
<div class="intro">
    <p>PDF is not new: it is thirty years old. It was not until 2001 and the introduction of tagged PDFs that they could be browsed by screen readers. , interfaces necessary for the blind and severely visually impaired.</p>
</div>
<p>Other developments followed, such as the flow of text, a technique offering the user wishing to enlarge the size of the characters an adjustment of the width of the paragraph to that of the screen, saving them from constantly scrolling from the left to the right to read a text.</p>

<p>Yet, two decades later, not all PDF documents are accessible, far from it. From texts scanned in image mode to a 100% compliant form, from LibreOffice to InDesign, there is a whole range of intentions and tools. Some authors, keen to properly structure their document using Word, will create accessibility without their knowledge, just as Monsieur Jourdain did prose without knowing it.</p>
<p>If, since 2019, Luxembourg public sector sites and apps have been subject to an accessibility requirement, the same is true of office file formats. Those published before the end of September 2018 benefit from an <a href="https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2019/05/28/a373/jo">exemption</a>, unless their contents are necessary for active administrative processes. A future article will review the issue of PDF accessibility among the most visited public sites in the Grand Duchy.</p>
<p>Since 2020, the Information and Press Service has offered a <a href="https://travail-publique.public.lu/fr/formation-developpement/catalogue-formations/secteur-etatique/04organisat/04-6- egalch/et_04-6-3-31.html">training dedicated to PDF accessibility</a> intended for the public sector. It is listed in the INAP catalog and is insured several times a year.</p>
<p>In this context, the <a href="../rapdf1/index.html">PDF repository</a> aims to provide a framework and all the keys so that each administration can audit, for itself, the digital accessibility of the office files that it makes available to its users and, thus, ensure their compliance.</p>
<p>To better familiarize yourself with it, the page “&#8239;<a href="../rapdf1/methodologie.html">Methodologie</a>&#8239;» invites you to download an archive containing a docx file, a second file which is the conversion of the first into PDF and a folder containing screenshots relating to each test that the criteria invite you to perform.</p>
<p>This standard is based on the European standard <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf">EN 301 549 v 3.2.1 </a>, more precisely its chapter 10, “non-web documents”, which applies to all PDF documents published on Luxembourg public sites. The criteria present there constitute an adaptation of the WCAG success criteria for office documents.</p>
<p>Certain criteria and techniques of the European standard have been deliberately left aside, either because they are irrelevant in the context of a PDF document (for example, focus visibility), or because the cases of usage are too rare (for example, all the criteria linked to audio and video content integrated into a PDF, sound control, subtitles, etc.)</p>
<p>Above all, the bias here is that all of what is verified can be carried out using the most common office tools (LibreOffice Writer, Microsoft Word, Adobe Reader to name a few). ). The choice was therefore made to exclude from the analysis <a href="../rapdf1/referential-technique.html#non-conforming-content-type">certain contents and certain structures</a> . The Adobe Acrobat Pro software, even if it benefits from a range of tools relating to accessibility, is not necessary in the context of this repository.</p>
<p>Also, what are we going to test? What elements will influence the conformity of the document? In total, <a href="../rapdf1/referential-technique.html#topic-1">46 criteria</a>, divided into ten themes, were scrutinized. As examples, we can cite the good management of images carrying information, respect for a minimum contrast, the presence of semantic logic in the structuring of tables, the relevance of link titles and, obviously, compliance of forms.</p>
<p>Experiment, test and <a href="../contact.html">share your observations with us</a>&#8239;: this framework is not fixed, it is expected to evolve, by integrating feedback from your practices.</p>
<p>Last question worth asking: PDF or HTML? As we have seen, it is perfectly possible to produce a 100% accessible PDF. However, the complexity of producing accessible documents is higher in PDF; moreover, their updating is less robust. It is possible to accompany the publication of any non-accessible PDF document with an accessible HTML document.</p>
