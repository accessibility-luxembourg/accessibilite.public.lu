<h2>These innovations that the world of disability has brought</h2>
<h3>Far from restricting creativity, accessibility has been the source of inventions and products that today meet the needs of all</h3>
<hr>
<div class="intro">
    <p>We are immersed in a world of technology; many of them were originally designed to overcome disabilities and some innovations were developed by people with disabilities. Their uses quickly went beyond their initial sphere to conquer the general public.</p>

<p>Here is a slice of life which is not universal, but in which everyone will undoubtedly recognize a moment of their daily life. To write this article, I used tools so common that it would seem pointless at first glance to list them: a <strong>keyboard</strong> for "writing on paper". ;» my ideas, several <strong>emails</strong> to discuss this subject with a few specialists, a <strong>phone call</strong> to check a source before leaving the office.</p>
<p>In the evening of this almost ordinary day, on the train, many people took out their <i lang="en">smartphone</i>. The sometimes lively atmosphere of the evening trains discourages some people from taking out their headphones, they watch their video without sound and so I glance from time to time at my neighbor's screen where the <strong>subtitles</ strong> automatically generated reproduce fairly faithfully <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FMGb4Wb0gO0">the lesson of Jean-Marc Jancovici</a> on questions of energy and climate.</p>
<p>Leaving the station, in the calm returned, the first pages of <cite><a href="https://www.audible.fr/pd/Couleurs-de-lfeu-Livre-Audio/B078GR1M1M"> Colors of the fire</a></cite> accompany me. Pierre Lemaitre himself reads his own text, the <strong>audiobook</strong> punctuates my end of the day, before an absent-minded listen to film reviews while listening to the <strong>podcast</strong> of the <cite><a href="https://www.radiofrance.fr/franceinter/podcasts/le-masque-et-la-plume">Mask and the feather</a></cite> in (very) fast forward mode.</ p>
<p>At the dinner table, everyone shares selected moments of their day and offers their best anecdotes. Little by little, children become less small: it is no longer even necessary to remind them of some basic hygiene rules, with the <strong>electric toothbrush</strong> it has become fun.< /p>
<p>Finally everyone is asleep...or almost. I hear my young teenager, headphones screwed on his ears, repeating: “&#8239;<i lang="en">next</i>&#8239;”, “&#8239;<i lang ="en">next</i>&#8239;”, I deduce that he leaves each piece of his musical playlist “&#8239;discovery&#8239;” quite unlikely to be appreciated. And for tomorrow, shirt or sweater? <strong>Siri</strong> tells me summer weather, showers are expected.</p>
<p>From morning to evening, I use tools that simplify my life, help me in my professional tasks, make my journeys smoother... I have adopted tools designed for the disabled, sometimes designed by them.</p>
<p>Who invented the keyboard? Christopher Sholes, Carlos Glidden and Samuel Soule are regularly <a href="https://history-computer.com/modern-computer-keyboard/">cited</a> as the designers of the QWERTY keyboard. We are at the end of the 19th century and their typewriter was a few years later <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sholes_and_Glidden_typewriter">marketed by Remington</a>.</p>

<p>This story, however, quickly glosses over the invention of Pierre Foucault, a French inventor who became blind at a very young age. He collaborated with Louis Braille, who developed the alphabet in salient points. One of Pierre Foucault's objectives was to allow blind people to communicate in writing with sighted people. He thus produced in the middle of the 19th century a “<a href="http://fondationdutoucher.org/histoire-du-clavier-alphanumerique-une-ergonomie-a-laveugle/">clavier-imprimeur</ a>&#8239;”. This typewriter, made up of thirty levers ending in engraved punches, each operated by a key, made it possible to write in raphigraphy. This <a href="https://gallica.bnf.fr/blog/12102020/histoire-de-la-machine-ecrire">typographic system</a> reproduced in relief letters on paper, readable both from tactile way by the blind and visual way by sighted people not trained in the Braille alphabet.</p>
<p>From the United States to France, let us continue our journey to Italy, in the very early hours of the same 19th century: there we find a blind countess, Carolina Fantoni; the countess's brother, Agostino&#8239;; finally a noble – and very gifted mechanic: Pellegrino Turri. <a href="https://blog.lib.uiowa.edu/eng/new-exhibit-on-the-history-of-the-typewriter/">According to an early version of the story</a>, Agostino invents the first typewriter to help his sister. Turri intervened to improve the tool by adding carbon paper. A variant attributes the invention of the first typewriter and carbon paper to Turri alone, in love with the countess. <a href="http://www.computer-timeline.com/timeline/henry-mill/">Sixteen letters</a> written on this machine would still be visible in a museum.</p>
<p>Let's go back to the 20th century and introduce Vinton Cerf, <a href="https://www.internethalloffame.org/vint-cerf/">considered one of the pioneers of the Internet</a> and achieved deafness. He had a key role in the development of the first email services, as he details in <a href="https://abilitymagazine.com/vint-cerf-co-creator-of-the-internet-and-email /">an interview given to <i lang="en">Ability magazine</i></a> in April 2020. His career is very rich, leading him to work among others for NASA, ICANN, IBM or even <span lang="en">Google</span>.</p>
<p>It was in this same company, and at the same time, that another hearing-impaired engineer, Ken Harrenstien, developed a tool aimed at automatically generating subtitles for videos published on <span lang="en"> YouTube</span>, as well as <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/20/technology/internet/20google.html">relate</a> the <i lang=" en">New York Times</i> in November 2009.</p>
<p>In a widely cited article, “<a lang="en" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/14/technology/audiobooks-innovation.html">Disability drives innovations</a>&#8239;”, journalist Shira Ovide asks the question: do you like audiobooks? “You have the blind to thank for that,” she writes, recalling the story of their ancestor, <span lang="en">Talking Books</span>, an initiative launched in the 1990s 1930 in the United States, when less than 20% of Americans could read Braille. Some visually impaired people had managed to modify their record player so that the story was reproduced more quickly. Today, it is this principle that is at work when you want to hear your podcast in accelerated version.</p>
<p>As for the <a href="https://science.howstuffworks.com/innovation/everyday-innovations/items-invented-people-with-disabilities.htm">electric toothbrush</a>, it appeared in Switzerland in 1954. <a href="https://homeaccess.nationalramp.com/news/5-pieces-of-adaptive-technology-with-widespread-appeal/">Broxodent</a> was originally intended for users with limited motor skills. It has become an everyday object for everyone.</p>
<p>These examples are by no means exhaustive; they aim to illustrate a movement, that of inventors who were keen to provide concrete solutions to situations of disability. It is not a question of drawing up a hagiographic portrait, nor even of suggesting that without them and, more generally, without the world of disability, these innovations would never have seen the light of day. However, they imposed themselves there with all the more force because they could constitute major progress, without alternative, where, later becoming <i lang="en">mainstream</i> objects, they brought comfort, more ease.</p>
<p>Clearly, many products are not always designed with the primary intention of making the daily lives of disabled people easier. This is the case with <i lang="en">smartphones</i>, which first conquered the general public before integrating accessibility options. If Apple regularly highlights accessibility as a pillar of its developments, the fact remains that Siri, as advanced as it is, is not yet able to respond <a href="https://www.boia.org/blog/apples-siri-changed-accessibility-but-no-voice-assistant-is-perfect">various situations</a> that those who have difficulty expressing themselves through the voice. </p>
<p>Whether it is the origin of an innovation or whether it accompanies it, and far from being a brake on creativity, accessibility stimulates innovative approaches. The disabled public has a driving role in the development of products which, often through a diversion or reappropriation of their use, also meet a demand from the general public.</p>
