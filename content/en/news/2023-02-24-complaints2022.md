	<p>Complaints about accessibility are rarely resolved</p>

<div class="intro">
    <p>Some users with disabilities take the opportunity to alert the SIP or the Ombusdman about the digital accessibility problems they experience on a daily basis. They are rarely offered an appropriate solution in the short term.</p>
</div>
<p>In 2022, the <a href="https://sip.gouvernement.lu/fr.html">SIP (Information and Press Service)</a> received <a href="https://data.public.lu/en/datasets/historique-des-reclamations-relatives-a-laccessibilite-numerique/">nine complaints</a> from users who were prevented from browsing or consulting websites or mobile apps.</p>

<p>These complaints included:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Four related to apps</li>
    <li>Three related to websites</li>
    <li>One concerning access to a PDF file</li>
    <li>One concerning access to a CAPTCHA module</li>
</ul>
<p>Three of the services in question are in the transport sector, one in health and one in education. Four others are not listed.</p>
<p><strong>Only two short-term solutions were offered</strong> to these citizens - although, in one of the two cases, the request did not fall within the framework of the law: it concerned a PDF that was not accessible, but published before September 2018. Of the seven complaints that were not resolved in the short term, one responsible body never replied and another claimed that the burden was disproportionate.</p>
<p>Over the period 2020-2021, the SIP handled 18 complaints. Six short-term solutions were proposed. Two organisations had never responded, and four had argued that the burden was disproportionate. Two proposed solutions were not accessible either. Finally, one request was not acted upon because it did not fall within the legal framework.</p>

<h2>How do I make a complaint to the SIP?</h2>
<p>Any citizen can contact the SIP to make a complaint about the accessibility of a public sector website or mobile application. 
To do so, simply fill in <a href="https://sip.gouvernement.lu/fr/support/reclamation-accessibilite.html">the form on the SIP website</a> or send an email to <a href="mailto:accessibilite@sip.public.lu">accessibilite@sip.public.lu.</a>
Before making a complaint, it is advisable to contact the organisation concerned directly. The contact details can be found in the accessibility statement for each site or mobile application.</p>


<h2>One accessibility statement in four does not exist</h2>
<p>There are more than 700 <a href="https://data.public.lu/en/datasets/inventaire-des-sites-publics/">websites</a> and <a href="https://data.public.lu/en/datasets/inventaire-des-applications-mobiles-publiques/">apps</a> in Luxembourg belonging to public sector bodies. At present, <a href="https://data.public.lu/en/datasets/declarations-daccessibilite/">180 have an accessibility statement</a>, which has been notified to the SIP. As a result, three quarters of public sector sites do not display this <a href="/en/obligations.html#accessibility-statement">statement</a>, despite the fact that it is compulsory. This figure can be put into perspective somewhat, as the SIP may not be aware of the existence of certain statements.</p>
<p>However, this accessibility statement is anything but anecdotal. It is precisely this statement that details the complaints procedure. Whether you are blind, partially sighted, physically disabled, etc., it also helps you to understand how compliant the site is, what content is not accessible and what burdens are considered to be disproportionate.</p>
<h2>"Disproportionate burden": less of an argument</h2>
<p>The accessibility statement gives the person responsible for the site or app the option of excluding from the scope a certain number of elements whose correction, redesign or rewriting is deemed too costly in relation to the estimated benefit for users<a href="/en/obligations.html#derogation-for-disproportionate-burden">(more information on the disproportionate burden</a>). Examples include the subtitling of videos, or older editorial content that is deemed too time-consuming to rework given the resources available.</p>
<p>At the <strong>top of the list</strong> are <strong>PDF and Office documents</strong>, followed by <strong>navigation</strong> elements and, to complete the podium, <strong>authentication</strong> procedures. It is common for several elements to appear in the same statement.</p>

<p>The trend from <a href="/fr/rapports/2020-2021/report/" hreflang="en">2020-2021</a> to 2022 also shows that proportionately less use is made of the disproportionate burden argument. At the end of 2021, 79 out of 118 claims, or two out of three, contained at least one mention of disproportionate burden. At the end of 2022, these figures were 86 out of 180, or less than half. In concrete terms, last year, out of 62 new statements, only seven mentioned a disproportionate burden. Several factors may explain this encouraging figure: a less complex nature of mobile sites and apps, an update of previous statements from which the "disproportionate burden" aspect had been removed, and finally mobile sites and apps whose design incorporates the objective of full compliance from the outset.</p>
