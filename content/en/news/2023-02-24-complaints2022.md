<h2>Users always looking for solutions</h2>
<h3>Accessibility complaints are rarely met</h3>
<hr>
<div class="intro">
    <p>Some disabled users take advantage of the possibility of alerting the SIP or the Ombudsman about the digital accessibility problems they experience on a daily basis. It is rare that an appropriate solution is offered to them in the short term.</p>
</div>
<p>In 2022, the <a href="https://sip.temporel.lu/fr.html">SIP (Information and Press Service)</a> received <a href="https://data .public.lu/fr/datasets/histoire-des-reclamations-relatives-a-laccessibilite-numerique/">nine complaints</a> from users who are prevented from browsing or consulting websites or mobile apps.</p>

</figure>
<p>Among these complaints we can count:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Four related to apps</li>
    <li>Three linked to websites</li>
    <li>One concerning access to a PDF file</li>
    <li>Finally one concerning access to a CAPTCHA module</li>
</ul>
<p>Among the services targeted, three relate to transport, one to health, and another to education. Four others are not listed.</p>
<p><strong>Only two short-term solutions were offered</strong> to these citizens – although, in one of the two cases, the request did not fall within the scope of the law&#8239;: it was a non-accessible PDF, but published before September 2018. Of the seven complaints that did not receive a short-term solution, one responsible body never responded, and another asserted a charge adjudicated disproportionate.</p>
<p>Over the 2020-2021 period, the SIP processed 18 complaints. Six short-term solutions were proposed. Two organizations never responded, four argued that the burden was disproportionate. Two proposed solutions were not more accessible. Finally, a request was not responded to because it did not fall within the framework of the law.</p>

    <p>Better integrating the needs expressed by users remains, for 2023, an... accessible objective</p>

<h4>How to make a complaint to the SIP?</h4>
<p>Any citizen can contact the SIP to make a complaint relating to the accessibility of a public sector site or mobile application.
To do this, simply complete <a href="https://sip.temporel.lu/fr/support/reclamation-accessibilite.html">this form on the SIP website</a> or send an email to the address: <a href="mailto:accessibilite@sip.public.lu">accessibilite@sip.public.lu</a>.
Before making this complaint, it is recommended to contact the organization concerned directly, the contact details are present in the accessibility declaration of each site or mobile application.</p>


<h4>One time in four, the accessibility declaration does not exist</h4>
<p>There are more than 700 <a href="https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/entreprises-des-sites-publics/">sites</a> and <a href="https: //data.public.lu/fr/datasets/inventory-des-applications-mobiles-publiques/">apps</a> which, in Luxembourg, come under public sector organizations. Currently, <a href="https://data.public.lu/fr/datasets/declarations-daccessibilite/">180 have an accessibility declaration</a>, brought to the attention of the SIP. As a result, three quarters of public sites do not display this <a href="/fr/obligations.html#accessibility-declaration">declaration</a>, although it is mandatory. This figure can be somewhat put into perspective as the SIP may not be aware of the existence of certain declarations.</p>
<p>However, this declaration of accessibility is anything but anecdotal. It is precisely she who details the complaints procedure. Whether you are blind, visually impaired, physically disabled, etc., it also allows you to understand the degree of conformity of the site, what content is not accessible and what loads are considered disproportionate.</p>
<h4>“Disproportionate burden”, a less put forward argument</h4>
<p>The accessibility declaration indeed offers the possibility to the site or app manager to exclude from the field a certain number of elements whose corrections, redesign or rewriting are considered too costly in relation to the benefit estimated for users (<a href="/fr/obligations.html#derogation-for-disproportionate-load">more information on the disproportionate load</a>). Let us cite for example the subtitling of videos or even old editorial content whose recovery is considered too tedious in relation to the available resources.</p>
<p>In the <strong>first row</strong>, we find the <strong>PDF and Office documents</strong>, followed by the <strong>navigation</strong> elements and, to complete the podium, the procedures <strong>authentication</strong>. It is common for several elements to appear within the same declaration.</p>

<p>The evolution of <a href="/fr/rapports/2020-2021/report/" hreflang="en">2020-2021</a> to 2022 also shows that it is proportionally less used of the disproportionate burden argument. Thus at the end of 2021, there were 79 declarations which included at least one mention of a disproportionate burden out of 118, or two out of three. At the end of 2022, these figures represented 86 to 180 respectively, or less than half. Concretely, last year, out of 62 new declarations, only seven mentioned a disproportionate burden. Several factors can explain this encouraging figure: a less complex nature of mobile sites and apps, an update of previous statements including the “disproportionate load” section. was removed, finally from mobile sites and apps whose design integrates from the start the objective of full compliance.</p>
