<h2>RAWeb, a repository that truly understands everything</h2>
<h3>The new standard extends the RGAA to fully meet European requirements.</h3>
<hr>
<div class="intro">
    <p>After a framework dedicated to mobile applications (RAAM) published in 2021, then another dedicated to PDF documents (RAPDF) last year, here comes the brand new RAWeb (Web Accessibility Evaluation Framework). Has repository fever gripped the Information and Press Department? Why abandon a well-established benchmark? We explain everything to you, in three minutes, watch in hand.</p>
</div>

<p>The General Framework for Improvement of Web Accessibility (RGAA), developed by the <a href="https://www.numerique.gouv.fr/">DINUM</a>, is today well known to digital accessibility experts in France and Luxembourg. It incorporates the rules for accessibility of Web 2.1 content, published by the W3C and known as <a href="https://www.w3.org/Translations/WCAG21-fr/#title">WCAG 2.1 </a>. The RGAA transcribes each criterion in the form of operational tests, in order to make it clearer, more intelligible, more... accessible to developers, auditors, referents and accessibility experts.</p>

<p>In this panorama, a pitfall: in the European Union, the reference in terms of digital accessibility is the standard <a href="https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/ 03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf">EN 301 549</a>, the current version of which (3.2.1) has been in force since March 2021. This European standard has integrated WCAG 2.1, so that a concordance between each WCAG / RGAA / EN 301 549 criteria could be established.</p>
<h4>The European standard does not only care about the web</h4>
<p>But the European standard goes beyond the scope set by the authors of WCAG. Here are some examples of areas that are not covered by either WCAG or RGAA:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is it as easy to turn on subtitles on a video as to pause it?</li>
<li>Does identification based on biological characteristics offer an alternative method?</li>
<li>Does an editing tool make it possible to create accessible content? Does it guide its user to this end? Does it offer correction aids?</li>
<li>During the process of converting a file from one format to another, is its accessibility information preserved?</li>
<li>Is the quality of the video of an application offering remote communication sufficient (in particular to allow deaf people to read lips)?</li>
</ul>
<p>The standard is not limited exclusively to the web, but defines criteria that can apply (or not) to any type of interface.</p>
<p>The SIP chose to retain the entire RGAA and add the criteria it was missing. To the 106 initial criteria are now added, in the new repository <a href="https://accessibilite.public.lu/fr/raweb1/">RAWeb</a>, 30 criteria which make it possible to respond to all of the European standard.</p>
<p>These 30 criteria are distributed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The “Multimedia” theme receives five new criteria (4.14 to 4.18);</li>
<li>The “Consultation” theme receives two new criteria (13.13, 13.14);</li>
<li>Four new themes (“Documentation and accessibility features”, “Editing tools”, “Support services” and “Real-time communication”) receive three, six, two and eleven new criteria respectively.< /li>
</ul>
<h4>Will this change the lives of listeners and developers?</h4>
<p>No.</p>
<p>Apart from a few essentially multimedia-oriented criteria and the “Support Services” theme, the vast majority of newcomers will apply in very specific contexts. It will therefore be rare for them to count in the context of a web audit.</p>
<p>In the future, future developments of the RGAA will continue to be integrated into <a href="https://accessibilite.public.lu/fr/raweb1/">RAWeb</a>.</p>
<p>The simplified control method remains unchanged, based on the same test criteria.</p>
<p>Please note that the RAAM, dedicated to the accessibility of mobile apps, contains from the outset the criteria required by the European standard.</p>
<p>2024 is the year of launch of the new <a href="https://accessibilite.public.lu/fr/raweb1/">RAWeb</a>, the year in which it will be applied, particularly in as part of the comprehensive audit campaign. We invite you, over the coming weeks, to share your feedback with us, by sending us a message to the address <a href="mailto:accessibilite@sip.etat.lu">accessibilite@sip. etat.lu</a> or on the <a href="https://github.com/accessibility-luxembourg/ReferentielAccessibiliteWeb">GitHub repository of the project</a>.</p>
