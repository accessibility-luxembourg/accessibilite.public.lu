<p>Screen readers are practical, even essential for blind people, but they are not without their flaws. For example, many languages are still missing. For Luxembourgish, the SIP offers a solution available today in beta testing to enable blind or visually impaired people to obtain the most accurate reproduction of digital content possible.</p>
<p>This solution consists of two voices – a female voice, Mia, and a male voice, Mil – which have been trained to reproduce texts written in Luxembourgish as accurately as possible. These voices are also capable of reading a few words or parts of sentences in French, as is often found in texts written in Luxembourgish.</p>
<p>These new voices are available via the RHVoice application, which has long provided synthesized voices that are not always integrated into major operating systems. The RHVoice application works on four environments: Windows, macOS, Android and iOS.</p>
<h2>Why a beta test?</h2>
<p>After a development phase, initial tests were carried out to evaluate the two voices. They are now sufficiently refined for us to present them to you. However, they still need some fine-tuning, which is why we are calling for contributions until 31 March 2026. So be one of the pioneers and help make these voices even more realistic!</p>
<p>How can you help?</p>
<p>We need your feedback on specific points:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Any difficulties encountered when installing RHVoice or using speech synthesis;</li>
    <li>Words in Luxembourgish, French or English that are not pronounced correctly;</li>
    <li>Numbers, abbreviations and special characters whose voice output could be improved.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please send your results to <a href="mailto:accessibilite@sip.etat.lu?subject=screenreader%20tests">accessibilite@sip.etat.lu</a> with the title "screen reader tests" <strong>by 31 March</strong>. Each time, please specify the context of the test, i.e. the operating system, the screen reader used, the voice selected and the content read (e.g. the Website URL). Spread the word to your friends and family!</p>
<p>You will quickly see progress: every month, an updated version of the application and voices will be released, incorporating the requested fixes.</p>
<h2>Before you begin, follow the guide</h2>
<p>Guides have been written for each platform in four languages. We recommend that you read them before installing RHVoice and the Luxembourgish voices on your phone, tablet or computer.</p>

<h2>But who came up with the idea?</h2>
<p>This is a <a href="https://mindigital.gouvernement.lu/en/dossiers/2024/tech-in-gov/projets-tech.html">Tech-in-Gov</a> project, supported and funded by the <a href="https://mindigital.gouvernement.lu/en.html">Ministry for Digitalisation</a>, which took place during the second half of 2025, following the selection of <a href="https://louderpages.org/">LouderPages</a>, a specialist in the field who contributes to the <a href="https://rhvoice.org/">RHVoice</a> solution. The <a href="https://sip.gouvernement.lu/en.html">SIP</a> was also able to count on the support of the <a href="https://cc-cdv.lu/">CDV</a>, which produced the first user tests and provided numerous corrective suggestions. The <a href="https://portal.education.lu/zls">ZLS</a> is also one of the key players: it provided central elements of the speech synthesis and supported us throughout the project on issues of prosody, grammar and lexicon..</p>
