<h2>Which sites and apps for an audit in 2024 and 2025?</h2>
<h3>You can react to the sample proposal developed by the SIP until January 12, 2024.</h3>

<div class="intro">
    <p>The 2023 digital accessibility audit campaign is ending and, at the beginning of January, we will publish here the summary of the main conclusions that we were able to draw from this annual exercise. But, before looking in the rearview mirror, the SIP has prepared a sample proposal within the framework of digital accessibility control, for the years 2024 and 2025.</p>

<p>The underlying idea is to give additional leeway to the bodies concerned in order to aim for full compliance, an objective set by <a href="https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg /law/2019/05/28/a373/jo">the law of May 2019</a>.</p>
<p>The publication of this proposed sample also aims, as every year, to collect the opinions of the various representatives of people with disabilities in Luxembourg. An e-mail was also sent to them on December 18, to invite them to react and give their feelings.</p>
<p>The final sample may evolve, in order to incorporate their comments, and, where applicable, to take into account the observations made by certain public bodies. For example, it is possible that the schedule for redesigning a web portal does not coincide well with the proposed schedule.</p>
<p>The general public is invited to join the discussion, by contacting us at <a href="mailto:accessibilite@sip.etat.lu">accessibilite@sip.etat.lu</a>. </p>
<p><a href="https://data.public.lu/en/datasets/proposition-dechantillons-pour-le-controle-de-laccessibilite-numerique-2024-2025/">At this address</a >, you will find the sample proposals for digital accessibility control 2024-2025.</p>
<p>You can download two Excel files (one per year) listing:</p>
<ul>
<li>sites that will be subject to a full accessibility audit&#8239;;</li>
<li>sites that will be subject to a simplified accessibility audit&#8239;;</li>
<li>mobile applications which will be subject to a full accessibility audit.</li>
</ul>
<p>Please note that the number of audits per section must remain unchanged, i.e., per year, 15 complete web audits, 93 simplified web audits, 6 complete mobile audits. We are also keen to select an equivalent number of iOS and Android apps. Finally, for each of the web lists, we try to represent in the most balanced way the following themes, proposed by the European Union:</p>
<ul>
<li>culture and leisure&#8239;;</li>
<li>employment and taxation&#8239;;</li>
<li>teaching&#8239;;</li>
<li>housing and collective facilities&#8239;;</li>
<li>public security order&#8239;;</li>
<li>environmental protection&#8239;;</li>
<li>social protection&#8239;;</li>
<li>health&#8239;;</li>
<li>transport&#8239;;</li>
<li>other.</li>
</ul>
<p>We thank you in advance for your participation.</p>
