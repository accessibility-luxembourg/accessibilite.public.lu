    <p>Do creativity and accessibility go hand in hand? Is it easy to make a site compliant? How do we become sensitive to these questions? Geoffrey Crofte willingly took part in the question and answer game. Maintenance.</p>

<h4>Where does this interest in accessibility come from?</h4>
<p>As a rule, people for whom this issue has become a personal matter are affected, directly or indirectly. For example, they may have someone close to them who is disabled, or they may be disabled themselves.</h4>
<p>This is not my case, to my knowledge, but I was made aware of it around ten years ago, during my first professional experiences at <a href="https://www.alsacreations.com/">Alsacréations</a>, in Strasbourg. They already had a certain lead in web quality and had an accessibility expert. I learned from him and it influenced my user experience aspect. From the start, I wanted to do things well, so that users, all users, could navigate the interfaces that I was developing.</p>
<h4>Today, this concern has become a cause, a fight or, more simply, an obvious fact, as it would be difficult to imagine a house without a front door?</h4>
<p>Above all, the obvious: it is an integral part of my daily life. When I make a design decision, it applies to all users, including people with disabilities. The texts must be large and contrasting enough for everyone, to cite just this example, but there are many other points of attention.</p>
<p>Also, when I notice glaring problems on other platforms, I point them out, on LinkedIn or Twitter; In general I am quite direct. This is where the struggle lies for me, because there is resistance to change. The classic feedback that I receive, “thank you, we will pass it on to our technical teams”, which is a polite response, does not necessarily lead to subsequent implementation. Too bad, because the solution to apply is not always complicated.</p>
<p>My experience within the Foyer Group, and in particular Foyer Assurances, also allows me to understand that above all, few people know that disabled people can use digital tools and that simple solutions exist. Unless we have people around us who are concerned, we easily ignore the subject of digital accessibility. Sometimes it’s just extra attention that fits into our daily tasks.</p>
<h4>Within your company, what challenges have you set for yourself?</h4>
<p>An audit carried out at the beginning of 2023 shows, for our website, a compliance rate with the standards in place of 34%. There is a way to double this score quite easily. Just as public organizations must be exemplary before the application of the new law on accessibility to the private sector by 2025, from our side it would be good to prove that as an insurer, we are the first to achieve this effort.</p>
<blockquote><p>“Beyond awareness, it is necessary to train.”</p></blockquote>
<p>And this effort will benefit everyone: our customers, the company and it is also an insurance that we take for ourselves, later... if we are lucky enough to grow old.< /p>
<p>Whether it's the developer who is more familiar with the semantics of HTML or colleagues who make their PDFs more accessible, there needs to be a trigger that makes them aware of the needs of these disabled users.</p>
<p>Beyond awareness, it is necessary to train. Half of my design team and eight developers are taking accessibility training this year. This was decided last year. Accessibility is a natural extension of the corporate social responsibility (CSR) that we have been defending for several years now.</p>
<h4>Is a 100% creative and innovative design compatible with a 100% compliant site from an accessibility point of view?</h4>
<p>I tend not to like the term 100% accessible... but yes, you can respect all of the WCAG or RGAA criteria and continue to be creative. The <a href="https://www.grenoblealpesmetropole.fr/35-la-metropole-de-grenoble.htm">Grenoble metropolis site</a> is 100% compliant. It is very beautiful and, which does not spoil anything, very easy to understand. This is an example to follow.</p>
<p>Today the techniques are there to produce elegant, animated content while respecting the preferences of those who choose to do without visual effects, display enhanced contrasts or browse in dark mode for example .</p>
<h4>If something had to change in the field of accessibility today, what would it be?</h4>
<p>Carrying out audits. The standards sometimes lack clarity or examples. From time to time, I struggle to understand what people are trying to tell us, although I am not new to this subject. Today, any person, expert or not, should have at their disposal a simple, documented, demonstrative tool, which accompanies them from start to finish with the aim of improving the accessibility of their digital interfaces.</p>
