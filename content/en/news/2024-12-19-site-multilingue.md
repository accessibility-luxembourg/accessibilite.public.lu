 <hgroup> <h1>Finally! The digital accessibility portal available in English</h1> 
 <p>Long requested, the multilingual version of our portal is finally available</p>

<div class="intro"> 
    <p>For the frameworks, and in particular the RAWeb, derived from the French RGAA, the exercise consisted in taking up, as much as possible, the terminologies present in WCAG and in the European standard, in order to give the auditors, already familiar with these tools, frameworks, equipped with tests and concrete methodologies, relating to known universes.</p>

<p>We have taken the greatest care in proofreading frameworks, news articles and other content available on this site. This work is notably the fruit of a valuable collaboration with the teams of the Information and Press Service. Of course, we remain at your disposal if you think that a translation could be improved, by letting you suggest to us which English term, which expression borrowed from the language of Shakespeare could be more suitable.</p>

<p>We took this opportunity to give the frameworks dedicated to assessing the accessibility of mobile apps (RAAM) and PDFs (RAPDF) a facelift, by integrating the presentation previously dedicated to RAWeb.</p>
<p>The growing popularity of the three Luxembourg accessibility framework, in particular RAAM, quickly spread to several countries in the European Union. This observation led us to initially focus on an English version, backed by the original French version.</p>
<p>All future content on the site (upcoming articles, upcoming updates to the repositories) will naturally be available in these two languages.</p>
