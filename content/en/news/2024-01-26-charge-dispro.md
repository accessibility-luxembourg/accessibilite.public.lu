<h2>From year to year, a less disproportionate burden?</h2>
<h3>In three years, how have accessibility statements evolved on the issue of disproportionate burden?</h3>
<hr>
<div class="intro">
    <p>Public bodies can exempt certain content published online from accessibility rules, citing the reason of “disproportionate burden”. when it is “reasonably impossible to make content or functionality accessible”. Behind this formulation, particular consideration is given to the costs that should be incurred in relation to the estimated benefit for disabled people.</p>

<p>These contents and functionalities must be precisely listed in the declaration. Alternatives must be able to offer equivalent content and functionalities... as long as their production does not itself constitute a disproportionate burden.</p>
<h4>One site in two today has an accessibility declaration</h4>
<p>In December 2023, we visited all of Luxembourg's public sites to arrive at this first observation: although it is a <a href="https://legilux.public.lu/eli /etat/leg/loi/2019/05/28/a373/jo#art_5">legal obligation</a>, barely more than half of these sites (51%) present, today, a declaration of accessibility. When it comes to mobile apps, it’s even worse: only 13% have them.</p>
<p>But it is this which indicates to users with disabilities the state of conformity of the site (non-compliant, partially compliant, compliant) in terms of digital accessibility and specifies, point by point, each functionality and content which were found to be non-compliant following an audit. Finally, it is in this framework that the elements exempted for disproportionate burden appear.</p>
<p>Consult our page on digital accessibility obligations, which includes a <a href="https://accessibilite.public.lu/fr/obligations.html#d%C3%A9claration-daccessibilit%C3%A9" >section dedicated to the accessibility declaration</a>, to check if yours has the essential elements. It goes without saying that this statement must be... accessible. For this purpose, a <a href="https://accessibilite.public.lu/fr/tools/decla.html">declaration creation form</a> is at your service.</p>
<h4>The declaration exists... is it up to date?</h4>
<p>Just as digital accessibility is an ongoing process, the declaration should be regularly updated. But many of them, submitted in 2020, were never submitted. In total, of the 418 declarations identified, only 68 were the subject of an update communicated to the Information and Press Service... or some 16%.</p>
<h4>PDF, navigation, authentication: the top 3 exemptions</h4>
<p>Three points clearly dominate the exemptions for disproportionate burden, first and foremost office documents (PDF and Office files), widely used by certain administrations and whose accessibility is more difficult to ensure than information published in HTML format. .</p>
<p>Closely follow, questions related to keyboard navigation and the accessibility of navigation menus: non-compliant, these functionalities de facto prohibit users with disabilities from the entire site or, in a better cases, make its use particularly complicated.</p>
<p>Finally, sites and apps using authentication procedures systematically cite the LuxTrust connection system, a third-party service over which they have no control.</p>

        <p>This bar chart shows, in descending order, the elements most frequently mentioned as a disproportionate burden in accessibility statements, starting with office documents, keyboard navigation and authentication procedures, present in respectively 31, 29 and 13% of declarations.</p>

<p>Other topics, less frequently mentioned, relate to search functionality, old content, links with irrelevant titles, poorly formatted lists and subtitles, videos without subtitles or not having a verbatim transcription, or even unidentified language changes.</p>
<h4>Fewer declarations for disproportionate burden: good news?</h4>
<p>In 2021, two thirds of sites and apps that presented an accessibility statement mentioned one or more disproportionate loads. This rate has decreased significantly to represent only a third of declarations in 2023. Even if we can a priori welcome this development, which would suggest that measures have been taken to remedy certain cases considered at the time too difficult to operate, the most probable explanation is undoubtedly to be found in the more representative number of declarations, which has almost quadrupled in the space of three years, going from 118 to 418 at the end of 2023.</p>
<h4>A point of methodology</h4>
<p>Any public sector body that publishes a website or a mobile app is required to publish an accessibility statement and inform the Information and Press Service. It is on this basis that we produced this article, but not only. A <span lang="en">crawler</span> went through all the sites listed in the SIP inventory to ensure that declarations that had not reached us existed, in order to obtain the results the most current.</p>
