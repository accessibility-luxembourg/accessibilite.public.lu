<h2>“Developer best practices impact accessibility”</h2>
<h3>Digital accessibility is becoming an imperative for many businesses. Stéphanie Walter, expert in inclusive design, insists on choosing the right partner.</h3>
<hr>
<div class="intro">
    <p>Stéphanie Walter began her professional career in Germany, before continuing it in Strasbourg, where she learned about accessibility. She is now based in Luxembourg, specializing in <span lang="en">Enterprise UX</span>. Consultant for Maltem, she designs complex business interfaces for the European Investment Bank (EIB).</p>
    <p><a href="https://stephaniewalter.design/">Her blog</a> is full of resources particularly related to digital accessibility and, on this theme, she already offers an introduction in English. This training will also be given to design students at the University of Strasbourg from the start of the 2025 school year. Training that comes at just the right time, as the <a href="https://accessibilite.public.lu/fr/news/ 2023-02-27-european_accessibility_act.html">European Accessibility Act</a> will have just entered into force.</p>

<h4>You are preparing a course on accessibility: is this a new proposition in university courses?</h4>
<p>Yes. The mission consists of highlighting issues of digital accessibility and ensuring that, from the graphic design stage, these problems do not appear: by questioning the relevance of colors, choosing contrasts, by providing keyboard navigation, giving space to functionalities (whether for example subtitles or transcription of a video), among others.</h4>
<p>This course must be extended by a supplement on the code side, in order to concretely indicate how an integration that respects the various criteria linked to digital accessibility is implemented, via HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>There is a whole series of good accessibility practices which are, simply, good development practices: associating labels with form fields, using the right tag for a button without trying to recreate the element through circuitous paths, mastering the languages before launching into Javascript frameworks... Developers' best practices reflect on accessibility.</p>
<h4>Today, what is your role within the EIB?</h4>
<p>I have the role of <span lang="en">UX researcher and designer</span>, which consists of designing interfaces and tools specific to the bank, used on a daily basis by employees. In my project team, I have held this role for more than three years.</p>
<h4>Under what conditions do you manage to put accessibility issues on the agenda?</h4>
<p>The bank has launched numerous actions in favor of physical accessibility. I wanted to push my pawns in favor of digital accessibility. We are recreating an interface designed and developed eighteen years ago. It is now rewritten in a new technology – React enriched with Material UI. There was a whole preliminary research phase to understand which features were used and relevant. Then work to refine the components in order to make them truly accessible – for example we do not just use a placeholder as a form label; we reintroduce the halo – removed by Material UI – when focusing on the keyboard.</p>
<h4>How is the daily work with the developers?</h4>
<p>I work with two front-end developers, who are not experts in accessibility, but happy to discover and learn. Furthermore, the team evolves, so nothing is ever acquired forever. It’s not easy, you have to regularly remind yourself of the basics and stay vigilant.</p>
<h4>On a daily basis, are there any general public digital tools that you use and which you regret are not easily accessible?</h4>
<p>The Luxtrust Android app. The developers have recreated a keyboard, which does not allow copying and pasting and on which, unlike the default keyboard, we do not see, even for a brief moment, the character that has just been typed. Likewise, there is no option to see the password in clear text. After several unsuccessful attempts, I almost had my account blocked. I can't imagine that everyone could easily use this interface.</p>
<p>In the category of websites, I can cite the French tax portal. From a cognitive point of view, it’s a horror.</p>
<h4>Do you feel that, in general, the accessibility of sites and apps is tending to improve?</h4>
<p>Yes, that is generally true. At the same time, I fear the appearance of a new charlatanism: companies supposedly specializing in digital accessibility and whose showcase site is far from compliant. The risk is to end up with site owners who think they are doing well, but will contact companies that are not qualified, or who will do the minimum with the help of <span lang="en">overlays< /span> (accessibility tools added as an overlay to an existing site, which may have limited effectiveness, editor's note). Some companies providing these <span lang="en">overlays</span> are now taking their detractors, accessibility experts, to court, whether in the United States or in France.</p>
<p>On social networks, we also find a series of self-proclaimed experts who spread untruths regarding accessibility or surf on a pure ableist discourse (ableism can be defined as the systemic discrimination of people in disability situation, editor’s note), ignoring the entire spectrum of disability. These are obviously not the majority of my interactions, but there is still work to break down barriers, or not reduce accessibility to a constraint.</p>
<p>I also fear the application of the law which will ensure the accessibility of goods and services in the private sector from 2025. I live in Luxembourg: to whom will I be supposed to report an accessibility problem on a Belgian e-commerce? We can fear legal confusion... It will in any case be interesting to see which company will be the first to receive a fine in this area.</p>
<p>If we have to go through this for our society's vision of disability, why not! There are many more people with disabilities than we imagine and integrating them into everything that makes up our society is an indisputable prerequisite.</p>
