<h2>For the private sector too, it is high time to get started</h2>
<h3>In 2025 a new law comes into force which extends compliance obligations relating to accessibility</h3>
<hr>
<div class="intro">
    <p>If compliance with accessibility rules today concerns public service sites and apps, in two years the rule will be extended to many private spheres. From June 2025, it will apply to the entire European Union and all e-commerce services such as sites and apps dedicated to mobility will be affected, under certain conditions.</p>
</div>
<p>The <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=1202&intPageId=5581&langId=en">European Accessibility Act</a>, <a href= "https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2023/03/08/a133/jo">transposed into Luxembourg law</a>, goes beyond the framework currently limited by the sites and apps to focus on areas as varied as computers or smartphones and their operating systems, televisions and audiovisual media access services, electronic books and e-readers, electronic communication services, electronic tickets or even banking services, certain self-service terminals such as automated teller machines.</p>

<p>On June 28, 2025, companies must ensure compliance with accessibility standards. In other words, the days are numbered. To stick only to the domains of websites and mobile apps, it can take many months between establishing specifications and putting a new portal online. As part of the upcoming redesigns, accessibility is no longer an option. On the contrary, it must become an integral part of the thinking from the first design phases, thus limiting any additional costs generated by this compliance. The Luxembourg law of 2019 in fact considers a site compliant only when it reaches 100% compliance, a prospect which is not a challenge and which was reached in 2022 by certain sites.</p >

    <h4>What will be the scope of the future law?</h4>
    <h5>The products (the hardware and software that runs on them):</h5>
    <ul>
        <li>consumer IT hardware such as computers, smartphones and tablets and their respective operating systems&#8239;;</li>
        <li>payment terminals, check-in terminals, ticket or ticket dispensers – excluding those present on board means of transport, except for exceptions provided for by law;</8239;</ li>
        <li>smart televisions or equipment providing access to audiovisual services;</li>
        <li>e-readers.</li>
    </ul>

<p>Making these services and devices accessible to everyone will make life easier for at least 87 million people according to the European Commission, or one in four European adults.</p>
<h4>Potential financial sanctions at stake</h4>
<p>The <a href="https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2023/03/08/a133/jo">law</a> transposing the European act provides by elsewhere the possibility of prohibiting the making available on the market of a non-compliant product or service and list of administrative and criminal sanctions, the latter being able to go up to 500,000 euros and one million euros in the event of recidivism. The fine is proportionate to the extent and seriousness of the non-compliance. To this end, a new organization, the Office for the Surveillance of Accessibility of Products and Services (OSAPS), will be founded and will have, among other missions, that of being the policeman of accessibility. Anyone can report the non-compliance of a product to OSAPS.</p>
<p>Certain public organizations, covered by the first law on accessibility – that of 2019 – could also be affected by the new one, particularly in the field of mobility.</p>
<p>On the other hand, micro-enterprises (less than ten employees, annual balance sheet not exceeding two million euros) would be exempt from the obligation to comply with accessibility requirements. Likewise, transitional measures provide for exemptions for self-service terminals, as well as for service providers who will be able to continue to provide the latter using products considered non-compliant from 2025. Finally, it will also be possible to put forward the argument of a disproportionate burden in the face of the obligation to profoundly modify the product or service. These transitional arrangements must end in 2030.</p>
<p>Despite these safeguards, this European Act prepares for a paradigm shift throughout the European Union, with the ambition of seeing products and services on the market that are truly usable. by everyone.</p>
