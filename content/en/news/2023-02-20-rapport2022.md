<h2>2022, the year of awareness</h2>
<h3>Digital accessibility under the microscope: what the analyzes of mobile apps and public websites teach us</h3>
<hr>
<div class="intro">
    <p>“In progress, but can do better”: this is what could appear on the report card of the 110 websites and mobile apps which have benefited from a complete or simplified audit . Among the sample retained in 2022, just over half of the sites managed to achieve partial compliance.</p>
</div>
<p>The subject of digital accessibility is spreading and is starting to be taken seriously, particularly if we refer to the second audit campaign carried out last year on a <a href="https://data.public.lu/en/datasets/echantillon-pour-le-controle-de-laccessibilite-numerique-2022/">sample</a> of public sites. The latter demonstrates a positive development, even if the study period is not yet long enough to validate this trend.</p>

<p><a href="https://data.public.lu/en/datasets/audits-complets-de-laccessibilite-numerique-2022/">Seventeen public websites were audited in detail.</ a> The average score does not reach 50% compliance, a threshold delivering partial compliance through the prism of digital accessibility. In the sample, nine sites currently exceed this bar. However, with 48%, the year 2022 gains four points compared to 2021 (44%). Between awareness and deadlines imposed for the redesign of a website, the year 2023 should show that good practices in this area are integrated and that accessibility has become a key point in the specifications.</p>
<p>This 2022 average, however, hides significant disparities. Forty points separate the most accessible site from the least accessible. Essential sites in the areas of mobility or education are not accessible to people with disabilities.</p>

    </details>
    <p>Below 50%, a site is not considered accessible. Or 8 out of 17 sites audited</p>
</figure>
<p>What can cause the rating to plummet? An audit is 106 criteria distributed across thirteen themes, following the <a href="/fr/rgaa4.1/criteres.html">RGAA 4.1 framework</a>. Here, the most problematic is not the most visible: thus, multimedia elements, such as videos, do not even represent 2% of non-compliances.</p>
<h4>Design flaws at the very heart of the machine</h4>
<p>What poses a problem is above all the very basis of the site: “mandatory elements”, presentation and structure of information, navigation. That is, <span lang="la">in fine</span>, the majority of non-conformities noted.</p>
<figure class="chart">
    <div id="full_themes">

        <p>This bar chart presents the RGAA themes sorted from the one with the most non-compliances to the one with the fewest, among 17 public sites targeted for full audits in 2022.</p>
    </details>
    <p>Mandatory elements, presentation and structure of information: the very basis of the sites poses a problem</p>
</figure>
<p>What is it about? The <a href="/fr/rgaa4.1/criteres.html#topic-8">“mandatory elements”</a> check the validity of the code, the presence and relevance of the language of the document, its title, or even the abusive use of HTML tags for presentation purposes. Placed end to end, these are obstacles that hinder clear rendering of the page by screen readers, used in particular by the blind.</p>
<p>In the same vein, a lack of attention paid to the <a href="/fr/rgaa4.1/criteres.html#topic-10">presentation of information</a> can lead to enlarged texts, but unreadable due to lack of flexible layout; to buttons or form fields lacking clear visual cues when they are the input target; to links whose very nature is not obvious (absence of underlining, contrast with the surrounding text too weak).</p>
<p>Alone, <strong>these two themes account for a third of the problems identified</strong>.</p>
<p>Very linked to the latter, the <a href="/fr/rgaa4.1/criteres.html#topic-9">structuring of information</a> inspects the relevance of titles, the coherence of the structure of the document or the correct use of lists. This trio – mandatory elements, presentation of information, structuring of information –, which consequently comprises the <strong>key pieces of the architecture of a site</strong>, approaches half (47%) of the non-conformities encountered.</p>
<p>By adding the <a href="/fr/rgaa4.1/criteres.html#topic-12">navigation</a> – relevant and recurring presences of a menu, a site map, 'a search engine -, <strong>the main non-conformities are summarized here</strong>.</p>
<p>Following this appear elements generally integrated into the body of the page: the accessibility of <a href="/fr/rgaa4.1/criteres.html#topic-11">forms</a >, the problems of <a href="/fr/rgaa4.1/criteres.html#topic-3">colors</a> (insufficient contrast, information only conveyed by colors inaccessible to colorblind people, images carrying information , like green checkmarks or red crosses, devoid of textual alternatives, therefore indecipherable by screen readers), the <a href="/fr/rgaa4.1/criteres.html#topic-7"> scripts</a> – via a few lines of code, it is easy to (re)create menus, carousels or even check boxes, but there is a great risk of forgetting disabled users by moving away from canonical HTML tags – and , finally, the <a href="/fr/rgaa4.1/criteres.html#topic-6">links</a>&#8239;: for example, it is impossible for a screen reader to interpret a link consisting of an image without a textual alternative.</p>
<p>To complete the table, four themes appear under the 5%, starting with the questions of <a href="/fr/rgaa4.1/criteres.html#topic-13">consultation</a> – we note here the control over the animations, the time limits, the accessibility of office documents –, the <a href="/fr/rgaa4.1/criteres.html#topic-5">tables</a> – often complex to understand for blind and visually impaired people, even if they are accessible – finally the elements <a href="/fr/rgaa4.1/criteres.html#topic-4">multimedia</a> – under -titling of videos, presence of an audio description... –, the <a href="/fr/rgaa4.1/criteres.html#topic-2">frames</a> close the ban.</p>
<h4>In the top 5, problems that can be easily resolved</h4>
<p>Let's take these <a href="/fr/rgaa4.1/criteres.html">106 criteria</a>, take them out of their respective themes and observe those which are mentioned most frequently, in descending order&# 8239;:</p>
<ol>
    <li><a href="/fr/rgaa4.1/criteres.html#crit-8-9">HTML tags used for presentation purposes only</a></li>
    <li><a href="/fr/rgaa4.1/criteres.html#crit-7-1">Scripts incompatible with assistive technologies</a></li>
    <li><a href="/fr/rgaa4.1/criteres.html#crit-9-1">The information is not structured by the appropriate use of titles</a></li>
    <li><a href="/fr/rgaa4.1/criteres.html#crit-3-2">The contrast between the color of the text and that of the background is insufficient</a></li >
    <li><a href="/fr/rgaa4.1/criteres.html#crit-9-3">The lists are not correctly structured</a></li>
</ol>
<p>Here, the rewriting of interactive elements&#8239;; there, a fine adjustment of a style sheet: depending on the points encountered, the correction time can be variable. Making scripts compliant is not necessarily a trivial task for developers. The other points, which concern content producers or designers, may be simpler to resolve. This involves correctly titling the different parts of the HTML page in order to help disabled people navigate easily, using tags dedicated to structuring lists and ensuring that the contrast of the text is sufficiently marked. </p>
<h4>Additional audits bring navigation to the top of the problems</h4>
<p>In order to open up a wider range, the Accessibility unit of the <a href="https://sip.gouvernement.lu/fr.html">SIP (Information and Press Service)</a> has even tested <a href="https://data.public.lu/en/datasets/audits-simplifies-de-laccessibilite-numerique-2020-2021/">87 public sites</a>, on <a href= "/en/monitoring/controle-simplifie.html">a simplified mode</a>&#8239;: three pages and 53 criteria, i.e. for each site a restricted selection of pages and criteria. The methodology is therefore simplified, it aims to raise awareness among a larger number of stakeholders by making them aware of existing problems on their sites, without aiming for exhaustiveness.</p>
<p>Fewer criteria, fewer pages, a different sample of sites: this selection reshuffles the cards somewhat, highlighting navigation issues, but the quartet of mandatory elements, presentation and structuring of information , navigation displays a comparable score, accumulating almost half of the problems encountered (48%), with the last theme predominating.</p>
<p>The themes of forms and colors are also very present.</p>
<figure class="chart">
    <div id="simple_themes">
        <img src="../../../../content/en/news/img/2022-report/simple_themes.svg" alt="Graph 3. Distribution of non-conformities, in percentage (see description below).">

        <summary>Description of graph 3</summary>
        <p>This bar chart presents the RGAA themes sorted according to the number of non-conformities, among 87 public sites targeted for simplified audits in 2022.</p>
    </details>
</figure>
<p>Here, the average of the 87 sites achieves partial compliance (54%). By following this simplified audit method, a site obtains a score of 100% (<a href="https://infocrise.public.lu">infocrise.public.lu</a>) and a majority (46) reaches or exceeds the 50% mark.</p>
<p>The interest in a wider range of sites also makes it possible to identify at which administrative level a significant margin for progress is possible. Thus, at the local level (municipalities, unions or municipal funds for example), the levels of compliance achieved remain twenty points lower than sites placed under the purview of the State. The latter benefits from a centralized service which makes it possible to better coordinate common projects, including digital accessibility, an area in which the team <a href="https://renow.public.lu/en/renow-en -bref/equipe.html">«&#8239;Web & UX&#8239;"</a> from the <a href="https://ctie.gouvernement.lu/fr.html">Technologies Center State Information (CTIE)</a> is aware and trained, and for which quality assurance processes have been established.</p>

    </details>
    <p>Centralized tools and a common methodology can explain the relatively good score of State sites</p>
</figure>
<h4>And on smartphone&#8239;?</h4>
<p>In 2022, six apps benefited from a complete audit – three times more than in 2021. The low number of applications tested makes the comparison exercise from one year to the next difficult. The audit for mobile applications is based on the <a href="https://accessibilite.public.lu/en/raam1/referentiel-technique.html">RAAM 1 reference</a> (106 criteria spread over fifteen themes). On average nine screens per app were tested.</p>
<p>Six apps, three under iOS, three under Android. At the finish line, there are less obvious differences: less than twenty points separate the back of the peloton from the head. The average of the six apps is 49%, or five points gained compared to 2021 – here again, the comparison is perhaps not right, only two apps had benefited from an audit during the first campaign carried out in 2020 -2021.</p>

    </details>
    <p>One in three apps partially compliant: a boost towards greater accessibility is necessary</p>

<p>Nine themes out of the fifteen in the RAAM concentrate all of the non-conformities noted. The following points are therefore not taken into account here:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Multimedia</li>
    <li>Tables</li>
    <li>Accessibility documentation and features</li>
    <li>Editing tools</li>

    </details>
    <p>One in five non-compliances is linked to components that disabled users cannot reach</p>
</figure>
<p>Under <a href="/en/raam1/referentiel-technique.html#topic-5">“&#8239;interactive components&#8239;”</a> hide tests aimed at verifying that buttons, links, input boxes, menus, dialog windows, tabs, etc. are compatible with assistive technologies and controllable in particular by a keyboard. The auditors also check whether the user is notified a priori of each major change on the screen. This section accounts for almost one non-compliance in five noted.</p>
<p>Following the themes <a href="/en/raam1/referentiel-technique.html#topic-11">«&#8239;Consultation&#8239;»</a>, <a href="/en/raam1/referentiel-technique.html#topic-9">«&#8239;Forms&#8239;»</a>, <a href="/en/raam1/referentiel-technique.html#topic-2">« &#8239;Colors&#8239;»</a> and <a href="/en/raam1/referentiel-technique.html#topic-7">«&#8239;Structure of information&#8239;»< /a>. The first five thus account for more than two thirds of the non-conformities noted (71%). The last four themes each represent between five and ten percent of the problems observed.</p>
<p>The development observed since <a href="/en/rapports/2020-2021/report/" hreflang="en">2020-2021</a> allows us to conclude that these audits demonstrate a desire to do better, a desire which is generally expressed clearly during audit feedback meetings, and which could pave the way towards a year 2023 with clearly improving scores. As the 2025 deadline approaches for certain private sector sites and apps, subject to sanctions if accessibility requirements are not respected, the public sector must, more than ever, lead the way.</p>
