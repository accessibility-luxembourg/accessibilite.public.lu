<h2>The lang attribute, to make the page audible... and understandable</h2>
<h3>One of the simplest accessibility elements to implement is also one of the most forgotten.</h3>
<hr>
<div class="intro">
    <p>In Luxembourg, perhaps more than elsewhere, it is not uncommon for the same HTML page to see words from different languages coexist. Nothing extraordinary: what is heard on the Knuedler is reflected on the Web.</p>
</div>

<p>If this cohabitation is perfectly possible, to ensure the most faithful reproduction of the text possible by a screen reader, two things must be ensured:</p>
<h4>Set a primary language for the page</h4>
<p>In the code, you should locate the <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> tag, the very first after the <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;</code> declaration. We add the lang attribute. Thus, for a page written mainly or exclusively in French, the code will be: <code>&lt;html lang="fr"&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>This is the perfect time to remind you that the code for Luxembourgish is not "lu" – which corresponds to <span lang="lu">Luba-katanga</span> spoken in the Democratic Republic of Congo – but "lb".</p>
<h4>Specify each language change</h4>
<p>Next, in the body of the page, it will be necessary to specify to the screen reader at what times the text changes language, for example by framing passages written in another language within the paragraph, as follows: #8239;: <code>&lt;p&gt;Granted, I don't like all of his films, but he had the talent to adapt &lt;span class="en"&gt;The English Patient&lt;/span&gt; at the cinema in 1996.&lt;/p&gt;</code></p>
<p>If you use a CMS to publish your site, it is very likely that it offers this type of functionality. When this is not the case in the default CMS, there are generally <span lang="en">plugins</span> to manage language changes.</p>
<h4>In this way, you will be of service to many users</h4>
<p>Who will all this be used for? We first think of blind and visually impaired people. They will have difficulty understanding the text rendered by the screen reader if it deciphers a text or a portion of text in the wrong language. But other users, for example dyslexics, will also be able to use vocalization systems. The same pitfalls on the path to understanding threaten them if language changes are not properly marked out.</p>
<p>Below is a one-minute video to show you the rendering of the same paragraph by the JAWS screen reader, without then with the language change indications:</p>

She closes Night Flight, fixes her gaze on the photo of the Twin Towers and evacuates: no, but what's going on dear? Antoine is no longer a whistleblower. Who will come and snoop on a Health Data Hub anyway? I protest: security is not a nice to have, it is a must have. She ignores it, prefers to leave singing Once there were two knights and maidens. They'd walk together. Out in the gardens. In all kinds of weather.</p>
    <h5><span lang="en">[heading level one]</span> With language change indication in the code</h5>

<p>You can try it yourself by using or editing, on the codepen.io site, <a href="https://codepen.io/dnauroy/pen/vYvVPdO">the code</a> containing the page read in video.</p>

<p>By making sure to mark up your text correctly, you check off no less than four criteria on the list of elements to respect to have an accessible site: </p>
<ul>
    <li><a href="../rgaa4.1.2/criteria.html#crit-8-3">8.3&#8239;: your page has a default language</a>&#8239;; </li>
    <li><a href="../rgaa4.1.2/criteria.html#crit-8-4">8.4&#8239;: the language code defined for the page is relevant</a>&#8239; ;</li>
    <li><a href="../rgaa4.1.2/criteria.html#crit-8-7">8.7&#8239;: each language change is indicated in the source code</a>&#8239; ;</li>
    <li><a href="../rgaa4.1.2/criteria.html#crit-8-8">8.8&#8239;: the language code of each language change is valid and relevant</a>. </li>
</ul>

<p>And yet, in the audits regularly conducted by the <a href="https://sip.temporel.lu/fr.html">Information and Press Service</a> on a selection of public sites, if the The language attribute defined at the page level is almost never missing, however language changes within the body of the page are very rarely indicated.</p>

<h4>But by the way... is my word in the dictionary?</h4>

<p>Be careful, conversely, to use the <code>lang</code> attribute only when necessary. Certain words, borrowed from English, are found today in French dictionaries. Planning is one of them. In a page written in French, it is therefore not necessary to specify it in the code. If in doubt, do not hesitate to consult the official dictionaries for languages frequently used on Luxembourg public sites:</p>

<ul>
    <li>for Luxembourgish&#8239;: <a href="https://lod.lu/" lang="lb">Lëtzebuerger Online Dictionary (LOD)</a> (the use of <a href=" https://spellchecker.lu/">spellchecker.lu</a> can help detect words missing from the dictionary)&#8239;;</li>
    <li>for French: <a href="http://atilf.atilf.fr/tlfi.htm">Computerized French Language Treasure</a>&#8239;;</li>
    <li>for German: <a href="https://www.dwds.de/" lang="de">Digitales Wörterbuch der deutschen Sprache</a>&#8239;;</li >
    <li>for English: <a href="https://www.oed.com/" lang="en">Oxford English Dictionary</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>To conclude, let us cite reasons other than those strictly related to accessibility. Knowing the language correctly will be of great help to online translation tools (we can think of the automatic page translation service provided by Google Chrome). We can think of other flexibility: thus, third-party programs included in the page (such as a video player) will display their navigation menu in the language specified at the page level. Finally, to finish on purely stylistic considerations, the management of hyphenation via the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/hyphens">hyphens</a property > is provided by the browser when you enter the <code>lang</code> attribute for the languages supported by your browser.</p>
