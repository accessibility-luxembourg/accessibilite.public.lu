 <h1>Experts in mobile accessibility, you're going to struggle (a little) less</h1> 
 <p>RAAM 1.1 has just been unveiled! With clearer tests and methodologies, and an expanded glossary, the Mobile App Accessibility Assessment Framework has been dusted off.</p>
</hgroup>
<hr>
<div class="intro"> 
    <p>The RAAM, first presented in June 2021, has undergone its first facelift to version 1.1.</p> 
</div>    
<p>We have incorporated the <a href="2024-05-06-RAAM-survey.html">feedback</a> gathered in a survey last year about this change, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/accessibility-luxembourg/ReferentielAccessibiliteMobile/issues?q=is%3Aissue%20state%3Aclosed">issues</a> that were open on GitHub.</p>

<p>Eleven new entries have been added to the <a href="/en/raam1.1/glossaire.html">glossary</a> - some of them taken from the recent RAWeb, with a view to standardising common resources - while eight others have been revised to clarify the content.</p>
<p>It is with this same aim of clarification that almost a third of the <a href="/en/raam1.1/glossaire.html">criteria</a> have been rewritten, including expanded and more detailed tests and methodology.</p>
<h2>Example of a rewrite: the methodology of criterion 2.2 for assessing text contrast</h2>

<h2 id="jump-comparison">What's new?</h2>
<p>A new criterion (<a href="/en/raam1.1/referentiel-technique.html#crit-14-3">14.3</a>, dedicated to the accessibility of the documentation provided by the support services) has been added, with the aim of making the message clearer. This criterion was previously included in theme 12.</p>
<p>With regard to synchronised media, tests have appeared in criteria <a href="/en/raam1.1/referentiel-technique.html#crit-3-7">3.7</a> and <a href="/en/raam1.1/referentiel-technique.html#crit-3-8">3.8</a> to support live media. While these are included in the exemptions provided for in the law of <a href="https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2019/05/28/a373/jo">28 May 2019</a> (transposition of the Web Accessibility Directive), live media are included in the scope of the <a href="https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2023/03/08/a133/jo">law of 8 March 2023</a> (transposition of the European Accessibility Act).</p>
<p>Finally, for each criterion where possible, a link has been established to the <a href="https://appt.org/en/guidelines/wcag/">APPT documentation</a>. APPT offers a technical guide to making apps accessible. It provides example code scripts in various languages that meet the requirements set out.</p>
<p>The <a href="/en/raam1.1/environnement.html">test environment</a> now includes the latest and penultimate versions of iOS and Android.</p>
<p>We end this overview with the <a href="/en/raam1.1/methodologie.html">methodology</a> page: it includes all the information that was previously shared with the 'legal requirements' page. This 'legal requirements' page has been slimmed down, so that all the information relating to the frameworks can be found under their respective menu items. The methodology also specifies that it is possible to test with or without a keyboard accessibility service on Android. Finally, the section entitled <a href="/en/raam1.1/methodologie.html#take-screenshots">"Take screenshots"</a> explains how to evaluate text sizes for criterion 2.2.</p>
