 <hgroup><h1>Experts in mobile accessibility, you're going to struggle (a little) less</h1> 
 <p>RAAM 1.1 unveiled! With clearer tests and methodologies, and an expanded glossary, the Mobile App Accessibility Assessment Framework has been dusted off.</p>
</hgroup>
<hr>
<div class="intro"> 
    <p>The RAAM, first presented in June 2021, has undergone its first facelift to version 1.1. We have incorporated the <a href="2024-05-06-RAAM-survey.html">opinions</a> gathered in a survey last year about this change, as well as the <a href="https://github.com/accessibility-luxembourg/ReferentielAccessibiliteMobile/issues">issues</a> that were open on GitHub.</p>

<p>Eleven new entries have been added to the glossary - some of them taken from the recent RAWeb, with a view to standardising common resources - while eight others have been revised to clarify the content.</p>
<p>It is with this same aim of clarification that almost a third of the criteria have been rewritten, including expanded and more detailed tests and methodology.</p>
<h2>Example of a rewrite: the methodology of criterion 2.2 for assessing contrast:</h2>

<p>A new criterion (14.3, dedicated to the accessibility of the documentation provided by the support service) has been added, with the aim of making the message clearer. This criterion was previously included in theme 12.</p>
<p>With regard to synchronised media, tests have appeared in criteria 3.7 and 3.8 to support live media. While these are included in the exemptions provided for in the law of 28 May 2019 (transposition of the Web Accessibility Directive), live media are included in the scope of the law of 8 March 2023 (transposition of the European Accessibility Act).</p>
<p>Finally, for each criterion where possible, a link has been established to the APPT documentation. APPT offers a technical guide to making apps accessible. It provides example code scripts in various languages that meet the requirements set out.</p>
<p>The test environment now includes the latest and penultimate versions of iOS and Android.</p>
<p>We end this overview with the Methodology page: it includes all the information that was previously shared with the 'Requirements' page. The 'Obligations' page has been slimmed down, so that all the information relating to the frameworks can be found under their respective menu items. The methodology also specifies that it is possible to test with or without a keyboard accessibility service on Android. Finally, the section entitled "Take screenshots" meets the requirements for calculating text sizes for criterion 2.2.</p>
