*Version 1.0, released June 21, 2021*

According to the [Luxembourg law of May 28, 2019](http://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2019/05/28/a373/jo), all websites and mobile applications of Luxembourg public sector organizations must be accessible. The [Information and Press Service](https://sip.gouvernement.lu/) is responsible for controlling their accessibility.

In this context, the benchmark for evaluating the accessibility of mobile applications was developed to serve as a basis for evaluation and implementation for all public sector organizations concerned by the law.

This framework provides an operational framework for verifying compliance with accessibility requirements. Therefore, it makes it possible to verify that a mobile application complies with the criteria described in the European standard [EN 301 549 v.3.2.1](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/ 03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf) for the following sections:

- 5 Generic requirements
- 6 ICT with two-way voice communication
- 7 ICT with video capabilities
- 10 Non-web documents
- 11 Software
- 12 Documentation and support services

It includes 107 control criteria.
