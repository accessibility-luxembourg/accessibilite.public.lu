Digital accessibility is often seen as an additional cost when the first contact with this discipline occurs on an existing project for which accessibility had not until now been taken into account. By way of comparison with the construction industry, it is often said that it is much more expensive to add an elevator to an existing building than to plan for it from the start in the project.

In the area of digital accessibility, the situation is very similar. The earlier a concern of this order is integrated into the planning of a project, the better it is integrated and the less the costs are affected: this is what is recommended, among others, by the “[shift left]” methodology. (https://feather.ca/shift-left/).”

Many administrations do not develop their websites and mobile applications in-house, but use the services of external providers. In this case, it is very common to go through specifications to define the needs and the expected result.

Digital accessibility being a legal obligation, it must therefore be present in any specifications for a public website or mobile application. However, it does not seem very effective to restrict ourselves to a sentence like: “The website must be accessible. » Indeed, the [digital accessibility law](https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2019/05/28/a373/jo) is relatively young (2020), the expected level of requirements is not yet known to everyone.

To help you draft your specifications, we offer you a set of clauses relating to digital accessibility. These clauses constitute only an example, which must of course be adapted to the context of your project.

### Example of clauses to include in your specifications

#### Accessibility

Digital accessibility means that people with disabilities can use services and content made available on the web or through mobile applications.

This is a legal obligation for public sector bodies defined by the law of [May 28, 2019](https://legilux.public.lu/eli/etat/leg/loi/2019/05/28/a373/jo).

Digital accessibility is a major objective of this project.

#### Legal level compliance

Please note that the legal level of conformity for websites is level AA of the _Web Accessibility Assessment Framework (RAWeb)_ in its latest version and level AA of the _application accessibility assessment framework mobiles_ (RAAM) in its latest version. These standards are published on the site [accessibilite.public.lu](https://accessibilite.public.lu).

If the CONTRACT HOLDER cannot refer to RAWeb or RAAM, compliance must then be assessed against the European standard [EN 301 549 version 3.2.1](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_en/301500_301599/301549/03.02.01_60/en_301549v030201p.pdf), in particular the criteria listed in tables A.1 (websites) and/or A.2 (mobile applications) of Annex A.

The CONTRACT HOLDER must undertake to mobilize all necessary means to move towards this level of legal compliance.

#### Minimum requirements

Taking into account the characteristics of the project as defined in this contract, the HOLDER must ensure that the developments, contents and functionalities present a level of conformity at least equal to 80%.

This minimum requirement does not replace the requirement linked to the legal level (i.e. a compliance rate of 100%), but constitutes the threshold below which a failure of the service provider could be noted.

This minimum level of requirements concerns all functionalities and content developed by the MARKET HOLDER as well as the ability of any content editing functions to produce compliant content.

This minimum level of requirements does not concern content produced by the ORGANIZATION's teams as well as [content which would be subject to exemptions](https://accessibilite.public.lu/fr/obligations.html#exempt-content) as defined in the law.

For any non-compliant functionality or content whose compliance would possibly represent a [disproportionate workload](https://accessibilite.public.lu/fr/obligations.html#dérogation-pour-charge-disproportionnée) for the HOLDER OF THE MARKET, any exemption for disproportionate load must be validated by the ORGANIZATION.

#### Verification

It is recalled that the ORGANIZATION reserves the right to have verified, by means of audits or acceptance, by a service provider expert in digital accessibility, compliance with these minimum requirements during all phases of the project and deliveries (models , templates, developments, etc.).

In the event that the minimum required level is not achieved due to a failure by the CONTRACT HOLDER, the latter must take all necessary corrective actions.

These corrective actions will be the responsibility of the CONTRACT HOLDER.

#### Expert support from the ORGANIZATION

Please note that the ORGANIZATION reserves the right to use an external service provider, an expert in digital accessibility, in order to support it in all phases of the project.

In this case this service provider will be the technical contact with the HOLDER's teams for everything relating to accessibility and compliance with RAWeb or RAAM of the entire project.

#### Response elements

Candidates must provide as part of this contract all the necessary information, precisely indicating the methodology, processes and means put in place to meet these requirements.

Particular attention will be paid to the methodology and processes put in place to guarantee the conformity of the developments, content and functionalities presented on delivery; this may include for example (non-exhaustive list):

- The control phases (design, development, acceptance before delivery, etc.);
- The means of controls (internal audit, audit by an external third party);
- The materialization of controls (audit statement, audit report, certificate of conformity);
- The tool(s) used for the purposes of checks (automatic tools, assistive technologies);
- If certificates of conformity are proposed, a sample certificate must be provided.

#### Points of vigilance on technologies

Certain needs defined by this document and which would be essential to the project may require the use of particular technologies which it may be complex to make perfectly accessible.

If applicable, it is up to the candidate to describe precisely:

- The points of complexity or blockages inherent in the use of these technologies.
- The alternatives, when possible, that could be proposed in order to ensure the user has access to the information.

The candidate is free to provide any other clarification, document or example of deliverables that he considers relevant.

### Commentary on clauses

In this document you will find the different sections which are commented below:

- **Accessibility:** this clause presents the general principle of the accessibility requirement and the legal framework.
- **Compliance and legal level:** compliance is measured against benchmarks. There is one for the web and a second for mobile applications. Depending on the scope of your project, you can adapt this part. If for any reason these standards cannot be used (for example, the service provider does not use the language used in the standard), compliance can be assessed against the European standard which is available in English.
- **Minimum requirements:** this section defines a minimum level of compliance requirements below which a failure of the service provider may be noted. There are also various exemptions linked to the liability of stakeholders or provided for in the law.
- **Verification:** the organization will be able to have the service provider's work independently verified. We recommend in all cases to have such an audit carried out independently of the service provider. This allows you to have an unbiased evaluation and not take the service provider's word for it. On the other hand, an accessibility audit is a prerequisite for producing the [accessibility declaration](/fr/obligations.html#accessibility-declaration), which is mandatory for public sector mobile sites and applications in Luxembourg.
- **Expert support from the organization:** the organization may call on an expert at all stages of the project. Collaboration is expected between the market holder and this expert.
- **Response elements:** accessibility must be taken into account at all stages of the project. The idea here is to know what means are implemented by the service provider to ensure a good level of compliance.
- **Points of vigilance on technologies:** the candidate is asked to anticipate and describe the points of complexity regarding the compliance of certain technologies. These points of vigilance can subsequently be used in the prioritization of compliance activities or the management of [exemptions for disproportionate load](/fr/obligations.html#exemption-for-disproportionate-load), which must in particular be referenced in the accessibility statement.

In general, the references to the CONTRACT HOLDER and the ORGANIZATION must have been defined beforehand in your specifications.
